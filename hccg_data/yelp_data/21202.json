Both breads taste delicious, and obviously butter makes anything amazing.

This comes as large shrimp saut\u00e9ed with tomatoes, lemon, garlic, herbs and fresh basil served around/on top of a bed of angel hair pasta. I think that the proportion of the meal was a bit off -- too much pasta for the amount of shrimp/sauce given, but I was able to have leftovers.

I&amp;#39;m more pissed at myself I didn&amp;#39;t ask for a manager or get the waiters name though. Hot tip. If you&amp;#39;re going to be rude and degrading to a party that big, make sure one of the people you are waiting on wasn&amp;#39;t a previous NYC waitress in Manhattan who knows about ticket times, auto gratuity and the whole process in depth. Make sure you aren&amp;#39;t rude to the biggest tipper at the table and a now restaurant owner who knows how shitty a server you were and how unacceptable you were being. First off I&amp;#39;m going to say what in the actual Fuck. A party that big should never have 1 waiter to begin with. A minimum 2 would be ideal. How do you expect one server to properly serve and wait a table that big in a timely fashion while dealing with other tables in there section? That was completely unacceptable from the start. Do you not have table runners or something? With a venue that popular at the very least the table runner should have been helping bring food out. Is it because auto gratuity is already added on a table that big so you don&amp;#39;t care how the service goes from that point onward. Secondly the server. If that was my establishment he would have been fired after that day. The entire table orders water, except me and my two kids with me. We like to enjoy ourselves when we go out. The waiter said and I quote, &amp;#34; Great a whole party of waters, go figure.&amp;#34; Excuse you? Being in management and a previous waitress what the actual fuck. Doesn&amp;#39;t try to say it under his breath or as he&amp;#39;s walking away says that bluntly to the entire table. The people who&amp;#39;s tips contribute to your paycheck. Okay. Next on the agenda, we were seated at two separate tables outside not pushed together. Okay. At my establishment that&amp;#39;s two separate parties not one. We were added to one giant bill But okay. After taking the whole tables drink orders half of the drinks come out the remaining half is missing. Then he starts taking orders. \u00a0Half of the the tables order then goes in to ring the meals in before coming to take the other half&amp;#39;s order who has yet to have drinks. I&amp;#39;m sure you see the problem here already so I&amp;#39;ll carry on. So finally my drinks come out. But wait just the two sodas not my sons apple juice. I waited about 12 minutes for my drink. So I tell the server, &amp;#34;my son still doesn&amp;#39;t have his apple juice.&amp;#34; His reply? &amp;#34;Oh don&amp;#39;t worry it&amp;#39;s coming&amp;#34; well after 12 minutes it clearly wasn&amp;#39;t so my pissed off self sets a timer, because the waiter was very clearly reminded. Our second table in our &amp;#34;party&amp;#34; is time to order. The one in which I&amp;#39;m in. I told him to skip me because I was undecided. His fucking reply? &amp;#34; well you better know what you want by the time Ive taken everyone else&amp;#39;s order because I already put the other tables order in.&amp;#34; FUCKING EXCUSE YOU. At this point I&amp;#39;m livid and it&amp;#39;s taking everything I got not to march up to the hostess desk. So everyone else at my table orders except one other person. Who he says the exact same thing too. Except at that point I&amp;#39;m done being the clueless bitch he thinks I am and I say you know he has a milk allergy right, and a nut allergy, and an egg allergy, along with about 12 other things so it&amp;#39;s going to take him a minute unless you can name something on this menu that doesn&amp;#39;t have any of those in the mean time my timer on my phone says 18 minutes and my son still doesn&amp;#39;t have his apple juice that I shouldn&amp;#39;t worry about is coming. I think at that point he got the memo I was sick of his shitty attitude. 12+18. My son waited 30 minutes for a drink. He got his drink as the first tables food was coming out. I was pissed. My food came out wrong and while I was waiting for my added chicken for my pasta to cook probably because he was so busy rushing us he forgot to write down the order right the first table was asking for dessert and to go boxes. I could go on and on and on but that&amp;#39;s just the icing on the cake.

I do like this chain. They are very consistent and clearly - they know their niche - the cheesecakes. <br&gt;<br&gt;This location is in the Inner Harbor mall. A prime location with tourists and locals making it a very busy hot spot. There is quite a bit of seating outside when the weather is nice. And if going here during usual peak hours or weekends - expect a wait - as is the case at most other locations. Here&amp;#39;s why the place gets 3 stars in a nutshell. <br&gt;<br&gt;- Decor / design: The place is over crowded with more tables than it ideally should have. Especially the outdoor seating, was simply put - chaotic. We got a table for 6 outside and although the view of the harbor was pretty, our table was right next to 2 other tables and it was quite a mall cafeteria kind of experience. Then there was this whole umbrella issue. The attendants outside could not have the tables covered with enough umbrellas given it was s scorcher of a day. Again - very chaotic. <br&gt;<br&gt;At one point, we considered moving indoors. But after taking a quick look inside, it wasn&amp;#39;t a great idea to switch tables. It was a massive wait for a table inside. So we stuck to what we got. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food: I don&amp;#39;t think I have ever had a reason to dislike their food. If there is one thing I can describe the food as - it would be consistently the same across the board. No matter which location you go to, you know you are at Cheesecake Factory. Given the hot summer day - I got a salad. Sheila chicken with avocados. Very light and fresh through and through. Others next to me got fish and chips and Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. Everyone was happy with their meals including myself.<br&gt;<br&gt;Service: This was a very mixed experience. First the positive. Our waitress was very kind and always around to check on us. Our meals arrived on time. We were quite happy. Now The negative. The staff outside wasn&amp;#39;t very accommodating with the arrangements. Primarily the umbrella situation that I mentioned above. This is probably a point that should be noted by the management of this branch. They should either reduce the table count outside or figure out a way to make the patrons comfortable outside when it is hot and humid outside. <br&gt;<br&gt;For food alone, I would rate this location 4 stars.

I don&amp;#39;t remember that being there when I ordered it last time. This had the thickness and color of beans mashed with peppers and salsa verde that is really just awful. In texture and in being too spicy. I was told by the Manager that they put this on the Breakfast Burrito. Ok, fine, why the hell were my tamale cakes taking a shit bath in it? So they agreed to make order. It literally took 45 minutes for the order to come out. By then my date had finished HIS whole appetizer and was waiting for entree`. Which came out 30.5 seconds after my re-made corn cakes came out. Had to put them aside. But here is what they did. They put the entree&amp;#39;s under the heat lamps when they remade the corn cakes. I am in the biz and know the film that forms on heatlamp baked food LOL. Just a horror show. Next time, for better service, I&amp;#39;ll go to Towson or Arundel Mills. SKIP. THIS.

We declined and said we would take the stroller since he can&amp;#39;t sit up yet. After being seated we placed the stroller beside our table. After the hostess saw the stroller she told us we needed to move it because it was in the way. We tried to explain that he couldn&amp;#39;t sit by himself but she demanded we move it. My cousin got upset and left to go back to the hotel without eating at all. Very disappointed in the way things were handled and how rude the hostess was about the situation, despite telling her in advance we&amp;#39;d need the stroller. We would have gladly waited longer for a table where we could have had the baby by our table comfortably. Instead my family ate supper without 2 members joining us.

First off no matter what time of day you, there will almost always be a wait.

You can&amp;#39;t really complain too much about the wait, because you know going in that it&amp;#39;s popular. I have been to different Cheesecake factories for years, and being a native Californian, I have been to my share of them. Maybe seven or eight altogether. That being said, I was very impressed with the Baltimore restaurant because of its location. I can&amp;#39;t remember where the hell I parked, but that area is congested anyway. People do have to understand that the long wait is common for C.F. anywhere, so this is a great location to have to wait, since killing time in the harbor is better than a waiting bench. As for the menu, the Chinese Chicken Salad is the best in the business, and my favorite dish is Cajun Pasta Jambalaya (I hope I got that right) and \u00a0another amazing dish is the Four Cheese Pasta. I mean, you really need to try that. I don&amp;#39;t know how they get that flavor.", "rating": 5, "date": "4/29/2007"}, {"text": "My tip is to not enter this establishment. I was disgusted with the service, food, and supervision. This particular Cheesecake Factory location is an egregious misrepresentation of the Cheesecake Factory name. I have dined at many other Cheesecake Factory locations and have been more than satisfied. My server lacked any personality or interest in making it an enjoyable dining experience. In fact, she was so disinterested, almost every item we ordered was incorrect. Another few things I was less than impressed with aside from the service were the plastic cups our water was served in, and the red lipstick smeared all around my wine glass. I believe I ordered Pinot noir, not Pinot noir with a side of rouge lipstick. I understand mistakes happen in the restaurant industry, but it comes to a point where it is unacceptable. The manager was far less than understanding and sympathetic. In fact, he defended the server and said he would not allow another server to take our inadequate server&amp;#39;s duty to our table. After speaking with the manager it is clear to me why the servers have no pride in their work, there is no example to follow and no accountability.", "rating": 1, "date": "6/10/2014"}, {"text": "Okay this place is good on Cheese and cake. We went here hours before hurricane sandy came to the area, because I knew we would be in a hotel room forever when it was over us. The food is decent, my daughter totally destroyed some pasta with marinara sauce on it. Oh yeah! They love their garlic on that thing. I at a sandwich, because I was feeling run of the mill. The restaurant is nice, situated on the inner harbor with nice views of the harbor, sort of because you will most likely see a building. Service is okay, they pack you in there. They do basic excellently and the fam had a decent time. I think the people who cook for cheese cake factory should quit and start little restaurants all throughout Baltimore, because it is in need of basic clean food. Then the Cheesecake factory could like, train more of them. Then maybe baltimore could be known as the cheese cake capital of the world.....then.... Wait wait, cheese and seafood don&amp;#39;t really go well together. They already have lots of crab, but in favor of good food I&amp;#39;d ditch the crab thing in an instant.
