This is not only completely unsanitary it&amp;#39;s disgusting and gross as a customer to be standing there witnessing this along with other employees and nobody did anything. I spoke with the manager, Brock I believe was his name, he had a very nonchalant response to me, and to me seemed put out that I brought this to his attention. His only response to me was which cake was it? No apology, no comment that what had happened was completely unacceptable... nothing, at all. He walked back behind the counter and leaned in to speak to the two employees that had been cleaning the cooler and had one of the ladies remove the cheesecake I pointed out had been touched with the dirty cleaning rag. I will post the on Yelp also this evening to make sure the public is aware of how your manager handles things. I would have wanted someone to speak up if they had also witnessed this and that&amp;#39;s the only reason I brought it to the manager&amp;#39;s attention tonight. I will not return to this location and regret that I even stayed for dinner tonight.

Everyone has been waited on by that ass of a server, everyone loves the bread. Here&amp;#39;s why I like it: <br&gt;<br&gt;1. You don&amp;#39;t ask yourself, &amp;#34;What am I in the mood for?&amp;#34; before coming here, because there is no speciality - it&amp;#39;s the cuisine for all peoples. If you want pasta and your friend wants American, no problem. Cafeterias provide the same concept only the food is, well, cafeteria food. Cheesecake is not cafeteria food. It&amp;#39;s food to fill you, it tastes good - I don&amp;#39;t care abut the stigma that it&amp;#39;s a chain. <br&gt;<br&gt;2. You pay for the portions. Most of the dishes I&amp;#39;ve seen or eaten are fit for two. I&amp;#39;ve even noticed couples sharing a plate, which I would never do (I can eat my own well past a single portion to be too honest with you) but you get the point. CF isn&amp;#39;t friendly for dieters - it&amp;#39;s more like outright hostile. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve even heard from their own staff members that Cheesecake salads are as healthy their fried macaroni and cheese. It&amp;#39;s pretty killer food and CF is notorious for sliding around any exact figures as to how high in calories their dishes actually are and although I think&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s pretty slimy of management - \u00a0it&amp;#39;s America! If the restaurant skimped rather than plate too much, the franchise wouldn&amp;#39;t have made it past the first restaurant. <br&gt;<br&gt;3. The bathrooms. I&amp;#39;ll inevitably take the trip if I&amp;#39;m at CF and starving (but trying to keep a promise to myself not to eat the full loaf of molasses rye bread before my meal comes) and bored too. So, I&amp;#39;ll excuse myself and walk around a bit, take the long way up the stairs twisting around the ridiculous crowds in the waiting area. I&amp;#39;ll look at other people&amp;#39;s food choices (the menu is so large, I&amp;#39;ve only tried a fraction of it so it&amp;#39;s a smart idea to peak around). Finally, I&amp;#39;ll get to the bathrooms. Great bathrooms, love the full-length mirror. <br&gt;<br&gt;And it&amp;#39;s so important for a restaurant to have a nice bathroom. It&amp;#39;s like the tell tale sign that the food will be good or something, I swear. It&amp;#39;s like how a woman looks to see if her boyfriend treats his mother right (if he doesn&amp;#39;t, he&amp;#39;s supposedly going to be a cruel husband) - well, the same goes for bathrooms.<br&gt;<br&gt;4. The cheesy male servers. This isn&amp;#39;t what I consider the &amp;#39;best&amp;#39; part about CF, more like the most entertaining to exhibit. Look, five of my friends have been picked up by these goons -FIVE - ew, I hate to admit that, but it&amp;#39;s true. It&amp;#39;s like they see a table of women and call dibs on it or something, very strange. And for the 5 that have been picked up, probably 50 more have been harmlessly hit on, myself included. CF must attract an oversexed staff - maybe it&amp;#39;s in the water - who knows?!<br&gt;<br&gt;5. The dessert. It&amp;#39;s what everyone looks forward to, it&amp;#39;s the reason why so many women throw caution to the wind and go off their crazy fad diets, it&amp;#39;s the topic of conversation among a group of female girlfriends, just chatting:<br&gt;&amp;#34;Oh my GOD - we have to split it cheesecake,&amp;#34; one says.<br&gt;&amp;#34;Um....I&amp;#39;m getting my own,&amp;#34; the other replies.<br&gt;&amp;#34;LET&amp;#39;S BE BAD!&amp;#34; they both say.<br&gt;And then, kind of sadly, they&amp;#39;ll eat it and talk about how BAD it is for them. <br&gt;<br&gt;6. Their strawberry lemonade - served in a glass with the rim lined with a tablespoons&amp;#39; worth of sugar and a giant strawberry. I don&amp;#39;t like to order fruity drinks, especially if it&amp;#39;s nonalcoholic - but I always make an exception for this one drink - TRY IT.<br&gt;<br&gt;And honestly, the list goes on.

I went as part of a bachelorette party. <br&gt;<br&gt;First, they refused to take a reservation, even for a group as large as us, so we had to sit and wait for nearly two hours outside in the rain, because they do not have an indoor waiting area. Then, being on a bit of a budget and remembering those enormous portion sizes, I went for the small plates. The waitress confirmed that two small plates was perfect for a meal. Wrong! These were not small plates. They were baby plates! I had the ahi tare tare and the mushroom/zucchini/avocado fries. Those put together would equal a standard appetizer in your typical restaurant. No where near a full meal. Nonetheless, I had spent all I had allotted for my meal so I ordered cheesecake. I didn&amp;#39;t have a menu in front of me to know that it was nearly $10 for one slice!!! I could understand that if they made it all fresh in house, but they don&amp;#39;t! Then add to it the fact that my &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; margarita (150 calories or less) cost as much as the cheesecake! I could have bought two standard margaritas at the bar we would be heading two for the same price (still in down town KC).<br&gt;<br&gt;Then it came time for the bills. Several from our party asked to take pieces of the brides check. The waitress fumbled orally for a minute then just announced that she would figure it out and left, declaring she was smart enough. Well, that wasn&amp;#39;t entirely true. I ended up with part of the bride&amp;#39;s faire, and everyone else declared their checks correct and handed over their money before I even figured out why mine was so ding dong expensive. I ended up paying for a $12 dollar drink I didn&amp;#39;t even get to taste (most expensive thing on my bill) and have gratuity included already.<br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, the food is fantastic, but you better be willing to empty your bank account if you do anything but nibble at this place.

We had to wait FOREVER for a table and they weren&amp;#39;t even that busy. In fact the manager came over to apologize to us and actually sounded like a complete moron. They were out of some of the appetizers we ordered so another manager apologized and said she would take the other 2 off of our bill. Then we got our receipts to find that they added gratuity to our checks automatically. We only had a party of 6 and I&amp;#39;ve been there with a larger party and have not had that happen.

Went early because we knew it would be packed. We got there just in time before the dinner rush and were seated right away. The food was really good and the server was excellent and very attentive. I had the eggplant parmigiana and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the chicken and biscuits and he really enjoyed it. The prices for entrees are just a bit high, but where they get you are the appetizers and the alcohol. We didn&amp;#39;t order appetizers because we thought they were just too overpriced. My boyfriend had a Long Island iced tea and it was $10 and change and that wasn&amp;#39;t even for the top shelf. We got 3 slices of cheesecake to take home and share. Plain, white chocolate blueberry and the outrageous. They were awesome. Too much to eat in one sitting so we saved the rest for the next evening.

The wait was long, as usual, but once we were seated we got the same awesome service and tasty food Cheesecake Factory is known for. There were four people in my group and I can&amp;#39;t remember what everyone ordered, but I got the crab hash. There were too many onions or something I wasn&amp;#39;t crazy about, but the combination of the hollandaise and crab and hash brown was so good! My husband and I also each ordered a cheesecake to take home and both were delicious. I have probably only tried three or four of their cheesecakes ever, but they are consistently very good, probably even better than the food. Caramel is my weakness so I ordered the dulce de leche cheesecake and it was freaking amazing. Even my husband, who doesn&amp;#39;t care for caramel, ended up eating half of it. Of course this is always more of a special occasion kind of place, because there&amp;#39;s no way I could afford a trip here just on a whim, but every time I visit I thoroughly enjoy my meal start to finish.", "rating": 4, "date": "1/8/2013"}, {"text": "Fiance and I go here every year for Christmas Eve and have had great service every time.
