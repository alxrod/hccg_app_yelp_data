They offered for us to return to get the fries or send a $20 &amp;#34; gift card&amp;#34; in seven to ten business days. Because we could not afford to waste 30 minutes to get fries, we opted for the gift card.

Finding something delectable here is also not a difficult task as the menu is rather large. When a restaurant offers a myriad of choices while simultaneously delivering the same good quality at any location it&amp;#39;s a positive sign. <br&gt;<br&gt;VALUE: This is CF&amp;#39;s biggest obstacle holding them back from a perfect five stars. Everything here is pricey for the portion size, but I understand why. People flock to this chain in droves, so there isn&amp;#39;t an incentive to price items more competitively, and this makes me curious to see what happens as we enter this bear market. There is also a good reason why everything on their menu except alcohol has listed prices. Typical cocktails here go for $11-12, and they&amp;#39;re not top shelf and/or large either.

But it seems like every revisit, the place seems to have gone downhill on service. Maybe there&amp;#39;s better competition based on new experiences elsewhere. We had a birthday in the family, and was eager to have a great enjoyable dinner. We waited about 1 hr for our table, reason was big party of 8. Hence, we see parties of 9-10s that came after us that got seated before us. Then finally, we get a table and the server tells us all the fresh fish is out, even not your frozen cod or whatever fish they use for fish n chips is out. Then after talking to the manager, all of a sudden the delivery truck just delivered fresh fish on a Sunday evening, after we already ordered. Needless to say the food was okay, wasn&amp;#39;t worth it all that wait and scarce menu options.

Though the menu is huge the vegetarian options are disappointing. They have quite a few dinner salads yet all of them have meat. Though I can order it without the chicken, it bothers me to pay $13 for a salad when I am not getting the meat. The salads should have two prices a price without meat, then an option to add meat for an additional charge. By doing this the vegetarians won&amp;#39;t feel &amp;#39;ripped off&amp;#39;. <br&gt;I tried the portabella mushroom sandwich. The portabella had a tough skin and wasn&amp;#39;t enjoyable at all. The grilled cheese is very good but with a menu like their I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to order a grilled cheese. I usually order the Chicken Thai lettuce wraps and sub avocado for the chicken. They are wonderful that way. My main suggestion for the Cheesecake factory is to add tofu to their options. That way, vegetarians can sub the tofu for meat. That would open up the menu greatly.", "rating": 3, "date": "8/12/2010"}]}
