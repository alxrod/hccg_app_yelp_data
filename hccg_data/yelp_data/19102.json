We have been to several locations throughout the US. This is was very disappointing! We went pretty late on a Friday, about 8:45pm. There wasn&amp;#39;t a wait, which was nice! Our waiter took forever to take our drink order, which was just water. Then took almost 10 minutes to bring out the bread. I ordered the chicken Marsala and subbed Mac and cheese (additional charge) for the asparagus and my husband ordered the enchiladas. The food took a very long time to get to the table-nearly 30 minutes, and our waiter never came back during that time to check our water or get us more bread. By the time our food arrived, we had no water. They brought out my entree, but forgot the Mac and cheese. They said it would be right out. 10 minutes pass and our waiter finally shows up and I tell him my Mac and cheese never came. He leaves and more than 5 minutes later, he cane back with my Mac and cheese. My husband and I had finished our meals by then. I was pretty disappointed! So we ask for the check. I thought for sure, they would take the charge for the Mac and cheese off the bill. Nope. They charged me for it. I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting a free meal, but I did fully expect them to take off the Mac and cheese. I was not impressed with the service we received at this Cheesecake Factory. This was the first time I have ever been to a Cheesecake Factory and left without ordering cheesecake. Our main entrees were good, but the service really left a bad taste in my mouth.

One exception being The Cheesecake Factory! After all it&amp;#39;s all about the CHEESECAKE! <br&gt;<br&gt;Remember these are my overall experience. <br&gt;1. Employees are well trained and happy to work here. <br&gt;2. They have the most food selections on their enormous menu than any place except a NYC Diner. <br&gt;3. The portions are enough to take home for a second meal. <br&gt;4. The Cheesecake is just the way I like it. It&amp;#39;s lighter or heavy depending on the flavor you selected. Speaking of flavors, lots to choose between. I&amp;#39;ve got many favorites. <br&gt;5. Price remains comparable no matter what location you visit. I never felt I was overcharged for the meal. <br&gt;6. Service is always timely and food prepared correctly. One exception being newly opened locations that are going through a learning process! Naturally I had that problem in our NYC location. <br&gt;7. The atmosphere is pretty much the same at each location. I find it relaxing with mellow colors. I like the color palette. Bathrooms are always clean. There&amp;#39;s a modern trendy feel to the restaurant. A bar area in case you want to drink and meet friends. <br&gt;<br&gt;So there you have it.

I settled for regular olives but my drink was very strong and not at all &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; dirty. <br&gt;<br&gt;The waiter did not greet our table for at least 10 minutes after we were seated. The spinach and artichoke dip we ordered as an appetizer was really good! It was creamy and warm. Unfortunately, there was barely enough chips to get through half of the dish. <br&gt;<br&gt;Most of my party went with pasta dishes, including myself. I had the lasagna, which was very..flat. It was mostly noodle and very little stuffing inside. It was vegetarian, without meat, which i thought was a plus. Many lasagnas have meat only options, however where the lasagna lacked meat it lacked everything else. It was noodles piled on noodles. I was left not feeling entirely full. Others in my party had the three cheese pasta, a children&amp;#39;s pizza, and a turkey club. Given a taste of the pasta I wish I had ordered it! The sauce was tasty and the noodles were a tad al denete (which I enjoy, personally). The turkey club my sister had was said to be dry and the pizza was barely touched by the 5 year old because it was &amp;#34;too cold.&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;This would not be my first choice while visiting Philadelphia, but it was okay.", "rating": 3, "date": "6/24/2018"}, {"text": "I like the Cheesecake Factory on the simple fact alone is that they have many OPTIONS - the menu is extensive and that will usually meet everyone&amp;#39;s needs. \u00a0I am typically not a chain restaurant visitor, but when in a group or family outings - I go with the flow of the group! \u00a0In this case, if I am going to indulge - at least I can have a nice view and beautiful decor to enjoy my experience. \u00a0This location of the Cheesecake Factor has the views and decor in Spades! \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;I was with a few folks on this visit and we decided to dine on appetizers and drinks and of course the &amp;#34;cheesecake&amp;#34; to finish the night! \u00a0We had the Edamame, Dynamite Shrimp, Everything Pizza &amp;amp; Buffalo Wings. \u00a0We also ordered the Calamari - but it was overcooked - so we sent it back without any issue from our great waiter &amp;#34;Chris&amp;#34;. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;Chris was awesome - he was attentive and made our experience enjoyable. \u00a0I feel this is a great location and if you are in the area - if nothing else - go get some darn cheese - our choice for the meal was &amp;#34;Red Velvet Cheesecake&amp;#34; and the take home choice was &amp;#34;Key Lime Cheesecake&amp;#34; - Yummy!", "rating": 4, "date": "1/24/2018"}, {"text": "I should have looked at the reviews before ordering, maybe then I wouldn&amp;#39;t have been surprised.

The sauce tasted so bland, except where the waitress grated Parmesan cheese over. I added salt and pepper and there was barely any difference. Regardless, I finished about half of it before my boyfriend and I decided to take the rest of our food to go. <br&gt;<br&gt;I got home and I felt really sick all of a sudden. I went to bed early and when I got up for work the next morning I had an upset stomach. I called out from work and thank God that I did because a half hour later I threw up all the fluids I drank that morning. I threw up two more times afterwards and had an upset stomach two more times later in the day. <br&gt;<br&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t associate this with anything until I called my boyfriend at work and he said it sounded like I had food poisoning. I read up on the symptoms of it and he was right. I was shaking, feeling feverish, and my hands and feet were tingling. I had lost so much fluids that every time I stood up I started seeing black and white and had to hold onto something. <br&gt;<br&gt;My boyfriend has been in the industry for more than 20 years, owned restaurants, been a partner, and been a general manager. He said that when sauces are left out too long, they lose their taste, and that was probably why I got so sick. He said he noticed me seasoning my dish with salt and was surprised as places like the Cheesecake Factory have dishes with high calorie counts and are already so flavorful to the point of being unhealthy. <br&gt;<br&gt;I called the restaurant and told Anthony the GM what I had experienced and he offered to give me a gift card. I said no thank you and would prefer a partial refund for at least my portion of the meal. He said that it was not possible. I even offered to bring in the food we had taken home for him to inspect but he said it was not necessary. <br&gt;<br&gt;Due to his lack of assistance, I called the guest services line in California and they were much more kind even though they still refused to offer a refund, though they did offer to look into the issue. They offered a gift card as well and I was thinking to myself, &amp;#34;are these people serious? They think I want to get food poisoning again for free this time.&amp;#34; I said even if they can&amp;#39;t offer me a refund I don&amp;#39;t need a gift card as I would never return. <br&gt;<br&gt;Clearly TCF Is only interested in money and not winning their customers back or making sure their health inspection standards are on par.

Since it was lunch time we could order the lunch portions and go easy on the pockets. <br&gt;I&amp;#39;d never been to this location.. So one thing I will say is coming in and seeing the hostess stand on the first floor with no one standing there threw us off a bit, sent one of the girls up on the elevator and she ushered us to come up... As we rode up, we saw the hustle a bustle that is Cheesecake Factory. They didn&amp;#39;t at all seem annoyed or flustered when we told them party of 10... Within about 10 minutes we were seated. We had one waitress that took care of us.. I like that a lot better than having 2 for either side of the table, and she did an awesome job keeping everything straight. We all pretty much knew what we wanted since we needed time for food to digest and settle prior to show time that was one of the requirements, lol know what u want and no dessert. I hated the no dessert rule after all it was Cheesecake Factory, but hey the food was filling. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the salmon off of the gluten free menu, swapped the broccoli for asparagus, so glad I made that choice, I must say some of the best asparagus I&amp;#39;ve had in a long time. The meal as a whole was considerably better than any of the cheesecake factory&amp;#39;s I have been to. There is one 5 minutes from me that I usually end up at, but this one put them to shame. I&amp;#39;m definitely a fan, I usually end up here for convenience rather than choice, but this location is awesome. There was a slight mishap where when two of the girls ordered pasta with red sauce they were asked if they wanted tomatoes, so given the choice they said no, but it came out with tomatoes, when they questioned it, our waitress took it back but then came back saying that&amp;#39;s just how it comes.. She apologized, knowing she had asked them, the girls were fine, pushed them to the side and still enjoyed the meal, overall it was a great meal, everyone enjoyed, it wasn&amp;#39;t dragged out or we weren&amp;#39;t rushed, it was a success!", "rating": 4, "date": "3/21/2016"}, {"text": "I always have a good meal at any Cheesecake Factory but we were on vacation in philly and decided to stop, this was one of the best experiences we&amp;#39;ve had at a restaurant.

So we decided to give cheesecake factory a second chance. <br&gt;<br&gt;When we first walked in hostess greeted us but gave us a weird look instead of a smile . Points off there . And then told us there&amp;#39;s about 15 to 20 mins wait and we said okay that&amp;#39;s fine. She didn&amp;#39;t lock us in the computer at first until another \u00a0group came in after us and see us just standing there. We then was given a number beeper and told we could go right ahead upstairs . Surprising the wait wasn&amp;#39;t long . So that was good .<br&gt;<br&gt;Took us a bit to look over the menu because there was a variety to choose from. So our waitress came and took our orders for drinks and apps . We decided to get buffalo Blast and dynamite shrimp for appetizers (as pictured) . The Buffalo blast was good . The dynamite shrimp was okay. It could use a little more flavor . For entr\u00e9e I decided to go with the chicken marsala and my boyfriend got the meatloaf. When the drink came she only brought my boyfriend drink and told me my drink will be out shortly. I thoughts all the drinks supposed to come out at the same time and not just one and while the other wait for theirs . But okay. The first appetizer came out which was the Buffalo blast half way eating it my drink still hasn&amp;#39;t come yet and I was thirsty after a few bites . My drink didn&amp;#39;t come out until my entr\u00e9e came out which was probably 20 mins after . Sign of bad service because the couple next to us ordered drinks and all their drinks came out right away by a different waitress . After a few bites of our food we was ready to leave because my boyfriend didn&amp;#39;t like how his food taste and my chicken marsala was sweet and the sauce tasted burnt while I was eating it . I didn&amp;#39;t want to make a big deal out of it so we just asked the waitress to packed the food to go . I should of just stick to my instance and went elsewhere because the food hasn&amp;#39;t meet our expectations .

The appetizer came out in decent time and the food quickly followed but we maybe saw our waitress once at this point and I asked to order a sparkling water and she said sure I&amp;#39;ll bring it right out. 20 mins later still no drink, I had to ask another waiter to get it for me. Then when we were done eating we both had our napkins on the table clearly done eating for a solid 25 mins and our waitress went Missing and did not come back for the check.
