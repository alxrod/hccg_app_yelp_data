I normally go to their locations in Sawgrass Mills or on Las Olas so much expectations were based on those past experiences. Since we are currently in the middle of a pandemic every restaurant that I&amp;#39;ve visited has a pretty specific set of guidelines they&amp;#39;ve enlisted. The usual things such as face masks and social distancing are &amp;#34;required&amp;#34; here as well. Based on what I saw I&amp;#39;d have to say that they are very slight suggestions. <br&gt;<br&gt;Based on signage there is supposed to be one way in and one way out. At the entrance there was a young woman wearing a mask taking reservations. I gave her my name and number and proceeded to wait for an outdoor table. While I&amp;#39;m waiting I see plenty of people walk right by the young lady and go right inside. I&amp;#39;m assuming they will be sent back outside to put their names on the list but no one is sent back out. Also, the door clearly labeled &amp;#34;Exit Only&amp;#34; was used as an entrance multiple times and there was no one stopping people and sending them to the young woman to make reservations. That was bothersome to watch.<br&gt;<br&gt;Fast forward and we are escorted to an outside table. The table was kinda clean but it looked as though every single crumb and leftover piece of food that was on the table was just wiped onto the seat. They were pretty easy to see since my 7 year old was the one that pointed it out to me. We waited a bit for someone to come and wipe off the seats which got me thinking about dirty surfaces. I asked the buss boy that came how often they wiped down menus and stuff and he told me after every new guest. I also asked my waiter and he said the same thick, which was very encouraging until I put it to the test. When I received my menu it was pretty nasty to say the least. I&amp;#39;ve gone to multiple restaurants and everyone uses paper menus. Now I know Cheesecake Factory has a pretty extensive menu so that might be a challenge but they aren&amp;#39;t a mom and pop operation and this isn&amp;#39;t some low budget fast food restaurant so whatever the case may be this needs to be addressed. If you can&amp;#39;t have someone actually wiping down these surfaces then you should be offering paper menus or at the very least give people a link to view it on their phones. Yes, having someone dedicated to wiping down menus or investing in paper menus is an added cost but I believe it can be done efficiently and effectively if taken seriously. Paper menus and plastic utensils should be an option.<br&gt;<br&gt;IMO, it felt as though management was just pulling a PR move with the exit/entrance only, we wipe down all surfaces after every customer, etc. because I heard it all but I didn&amp;#39;t see anything in action... it was all a facade.<br&gt;<br&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t see much inside so I can&amp;#39;t comment on that but they were following social distancing guidelines outside. Every other table had been closed off. My waiter was wearing a mask and gloves. He was very professional and made great efforts to help me and my family remain comfortable. The outdoor seating was comfortable. It was very humid which made me realize that they didn&amp;#39;t have any fans or they didn&amp;#39;t have any fans on. The location in sawgrass always has them on.<br&gt;<br&gt;Their portions are always excellent. I always leave with a doggy bag. The food was good. My son had the kids grilled cheese which he said was very cheesy lol. Not sure which way to go with that but the fries tasted good to me. I got the orange chicken which was very orange-y. I can&amp;#39;t blame the restaurant but I&amp;#39;m used to eating orange chicken with a slight teriyaki mix. The brown rice was good. I wish I could remember my server because he did an excellent job and deserves a shoutout.<br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, my server and the food were both good. I felt a bit uneasy with all the social distancing errors I watched. This isn&amp;#39;t the first week things have been open so I&amp;#39;d assume that management has had enough time to fix the things they actually intend to fix which leads me to believe that this issues I stated won&amp;#39;t be addressed. I&amp;#39;m not sure if the problem resonates from the location or the chain overall but if it&amp;#39;s the latter then I&amp;#39;m just going to have to bypass them until I&amp;#39;m able to let my guards down. <br&gt;<br&gt;Seeing as Florida set a single day national record for COVID cases (worse then NY) on the same day I visited this location and witnessed all of this I&amp;#39;m not sure how long that will be.", "rating": 3, "date": "7/13/2020"}, {"text": "This business is not doing their best during Covid. \u00a0Walked in took my number and was told we would text you.

No greeting, no eye contact, no smile, no nothing. She pretty much seemed bothered that we were there. She basically glanced at us and waited for us to tell her what we wanted. Not a very good first impression. <br&gt;<br&gt;Fortunately, our server turned that around. He was friendly, polite, and welcoming. He was also knowledgeable about the huge menu, which no matter how many times we go, we still find it a bit daunting. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food was good and as expected. Nicely presented and served at the appropriate temperature.

We ordered some apps while waiting and our friend arrived just after we ordered the apps. So everything worked out well. <br&gt;<br&gt;We started with the edamame. They were cooked perfect and had the right amount of salt. We also had the roasted artichoke. It comes in 2 sizes. We ordered the larger one. Perfectly cooked. Not overly oiled and was tasty. I do eat vegan(ish) so I did taste the garlic aioli that came with it. It was very tasty. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food: \u00a0my daughter had the spaghetti and meatball. \u00a0I would have preferred 1 more meatball and less spaghetti but my daughter loved it. <br&gt;<br&gt;My husband and cousin had the burrito. It is HUGE. They both loved it. It came with beans, guacamole and sour cream on the side. <br&gt;<br&gt;My friend had breakfast all day. He had a build your own omelet made with egg whites. He asked for 3 special requests. He only wanted a sprinkle of cheese and wanted his bacon well done. Omelet came out PERFECT! \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;I had the avocado toast. \u00a0I have to say my picture doesn&amp;#39;t do it justice. It was super pretty.

My husband had the Oreo milk shake. He said it was a little thin but tasty. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;All in all our service is wonderful. Food was delicious.

Came for their happy hour during the weekdays at 4-6 p.m. and to use a free cheesecake card we had when you purchased a gift card (this promo normal available for purchase during holidays). JI was told to sit anywhere in the bar area to be able to get the happy hour menu. The menu had a lot to choose from, drinks, appetizers and small dishes. Price range drinks $3-$6 and food is $5-$8, that&amp;#39;s a price that can&amp;#39;t be beat especially at this restaurant! <br&gt;Since we were told to sit in the bar area we ended up waiting for a server. Which was strange because 5 servers pass the table yet no one informed our server we were there. After 10minutes of waiting I went back to the hostess to asks how can we get a server, her response was rude telling me that the bar is a seat yourself, I questioned her saying what does that mean. And informed her that she should inform service to that area or I&amp;#39;ll ask someone that could help me. Still she did not get a server. So I waited another 5 more minutes and then finally a server showed up. And they were not in the mood that day. <br&gt;Luckily with the time that we waited to be served we already knew what we wanted, so we can enjoy this happy hour. We order pretzel with cheese dip, crab dip, fried spicy shrimp, potstickers, and Korean cauliflower. Just remember you&amp;#39;ll be served bread while you wait for your food. We enjoyed the pretzels, cauliflower and shrimp. The potsticker were not what I expected it just seem like I had a sliced chicken breast that was wrapped in a wonton, there was no seasoning and just sitting in ponzu sauce. The crab dip also was plain lack flavor . <br&gt;Overall we had to take our cheesecake home, hazelnut cheesecake and red velvet chessecake, \u00a0because we were full. and it was the bread we ate because we had to take some food home so be careful and remember that there is bread to eat.

When we come here, we usually order the Thai Lettuce Wrap as an appetizer. This appetizer is fairly big to share around the table.

I would suggest a tad bit more goat cheese to justify goat cheese being mentioned as part of the dish. Cauliflower was tasty but salty (but tasty).

Changing scenery did the job.<br&gt;<br&gt;This time. I ate like a champ, the experience was one worth enough for me to create a review on YELP (kind of reminds me of the South Park episode, when the whole town business was controlled by YELP reviewers I had the fried calamari and the Cajun pasta and we order pizza and salads and drinks, best part yet, this location has a mirror where a wall should have been separating the kitchen from the restaurants.

The place in WAYYYY TOOO SMALL to have such a big chain there as the parking is a total nightmare. Nevertheles - we were excited to go to the barbi-doll sized Cheesecake Factory.<br&gt;<br&gt;Wow, wow, wow is all I can say. One would think that in such a successful chain - they might have some sort or pre-grand opening training in place? &amp;#34;DING-DING-DING&amp;#34; - &amp;#34;Wrong answer Johnny...&amp;#34; So being completely fair here (as ALWAYS)... it was friggen pouring for hours - so the hour long wait OUTSIDE was understandable. It was the chaos and hour plus long wait for the food that we are going to simply rip apart...<br&gt;<br&gt;So this time it was me, my lovely wife, and kids. (2 boys &amp;amp; 2 girls - the youngest is only 8 months). If you are a parent reading this - you will feel my pain of a 2 hour wait to finally get us all fed! <br&gt;<br&gt;The waitress - looked like she just stepped out of an MTV video from the 80&amp;#39;s with all kinds of bracelets and chachkas all over her wearing this neon pink lipstick and had strange murderous eyebrows highlighted by the gothic black eye shadow...<br&gt;<br&gt;Now for the fun part.. the sodas were all FLAT - the service continued to underwhelm us as it just took so long. I ordered soup and a well done English muffin (which never came). Also in her description of the soup she never said cold chopped tomatoes or soggy red peppers strewn about as a garnish. So the soup had cold dry chicken just thrown in as well as the artichoke hearts tasted mealy and certainly inedible... (SENT IT BACK) - still no English muffin - never mentioned again except for being charged for it (MY FAVORITE)...<br&gt;<br&gt;My 5 year old&amp;#39;s pizza arrived to the table late with a wonderful green slime around the part that was placed right in front of her, which she spots in an instant... The waitress says - &amp;#34;oh that&amp;#39;s only guacamole from another dish she had carried&amp;#34; - but was not from our table (NICE). So that went back - and it took forever and a week to get her pizza out again - by that time we were all ready to leave. This time the pizza arrives partially underdone - and it has thin spots on it - you can&amp;#39;t pick up half the pie... (AWESOME)...<br&gt;<br&gt;To be fair the Chicken Romano was enjoyed by my 13 year old son - $16.50 but the red potatoes were cold and not really appetizing for anyone. <br&gt;<br&gt;My wife&amp;#39;s club sandwich was yummy - she said, but the french fries we always ask for \u00a0well done like black... and as usual - soggy crapola...<br&gt;<br&gt;The sliders for my 11 year old son were fine - but then again he bearly can wait to finish to get back to his iTOUCH games - which he tried to sneak a game in underneath the table... No Game Playing while we are together in the Family Buzzom as I put it :)<br&gt;<br&gt;3+ hours go by and we are all spent - I am ready to get the hell outta HELL and while the wife is changing a poopy diaper I decided to pay the tab... and then it happened... I turned around to see the 80&amp;#39;s video extra and the check falls to the ground - while she is holding plates so I pick it up for her and she motions with her lips to place it in her apron pocket... I tried to but it would not fit, as there was another check book inside the pocket already - she then smiles weirdly and colorfully says &amp;#34;yeah a got a BIG ONE&amp;#34; - and laughs... <br&gt;<br&gt;Being that a joke like that usually would come from a drunk guy at a bar - i thought it was odd, yet par for her course with the entire &amp;#34;get-up&amp;#34;... Needless to say my wife wanted to place her face on a milkcarton :) <br&gt;<br&gt;So to top off the really long wait, really blah food and service - this was a HALF OF A STAR at best...

No complaints about the waiter but the food left much to be desired and very disappointing. i ordered a chicken dish and the second piece was completely burned on the bottom which I did not taste until I had eaten the first piece. By then I felt it was too late to return the food. The next time I will inspect my food closely prior to eating it. Don&amp;#39;t think I will be going back anytime soon. The wait was not worth the food which was sub-standard...unlike the other Cheesecake factory rest. I have been to.", "rating": 2, "date": "2/11/2012"}, {"text": "Excellent service! Delicious food. Wait isn&amp;#39;t very long and the hostess is very friendly and polite. Lovely location and atmosphere!

It was a bit busy due to mothers day but it wasn&amp;#39;t crazy. My service was great. My waitress marilyn S. was friendly..smiled often..and even though it was really busy she seemed to give us lots of attention. We order simple pastas..I had the chicken Alfredo and my sister had the three cheese pasta...when we received our pastas shortly after ordering...my pasta was bland (no salt or pepper)...chicken had no color and very tasteless ...the pasta was over cook and was mixed in with other pastas that wasn&amp;#39;t in my dish...and my Alfredo was very runny/wet..my sister&amp;#39;s pasta contained very little chicken was covered with tons of cilantro and parsley and was very bland...what is wrong with the chef did he/she not try any of the food before sending it out", "rating": 2, "date": "5/13/2012"}]}
