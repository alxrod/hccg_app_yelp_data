I ordered a mimosa and it came in a glass that was not only small but had a lot more orange juice than champagne. When I asked our server if it came in a 1/2 caraf or anything larger, the bartender told her she could put it in a wine glass and charge me twice the price, which would be $17.00. I opted out. I ordered the CA omelette and when I got it, the potatoes were cold. We had to ask for absolutely everything during our meal. More coffee, salt and pepper, another drink, and the check etc. we even had to ask for our plates to be removed. Our son is a server so we&amp;#39;re super sensitive about tipping well, but we only left 10% today which pulls on my heartstrings.

Most of the restaurant is still the same if you&amp;#39;ve been going off and on for over a decade like we have, and just like all the yelp reviews, always a long dreaded wait which usually takes much longer than they even say. We got our buzzer at 7 PM were told 30 minute wait.... after 45 minutes we were seated. We decided to split a meal, the wife and I, because we wanted to have room for cheesecake of course. We ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken that comes on a spaghetti type noodle, and instead of the red sauce we substituted it for their Alfredo sauce which is quite delicious as we&amp;#39;ve have \u00a0had it in the past. Plenty of food for two people if you have salads and such. We each ordered a salad prior to the meal, One house salad and one Caesar salad. The small salads aren&amp;#39;t much to speak of, the house salad is just lettuce us throw on a plate with really no other garnishes to go with it and your side of dressing. The Caesar salad was pretty flavorless and is so finally chopped it&amp;#39;s hard to eat but it is plenty big. The house bread thats served with any meal is absolutely amazing though. After our salads we waited a half hour for the meal to show up, way too long after we&amp;#39;ve already eaten two loaves of bread waiting, we let the waiter know that it was lukewarm as well, the manager and the waiter were extremely nice and we were comped the meal. That gave us even more of an excuse to splurge on the cheesecake, in which we got a large to die for caramel pecan turtle helping. Incredible, barely finished it. This review comes with a mixed heart, the food is very good but the wait was ridicules especially since you can&amp;#39;t call ahead for seating, and the fact that we were comped the main meal helped and just the fact that they knew it could&amp;#39;ve been better as well. I&amp;#39;m rating this three stars because we will be back of course, and when it&amp;#39;s better I will adjust my rating. My biggest tip would be to come when you have extra time so you can get a buzzer and go maybe walk around the mall and shop till about 10 minutes before they say so you&amp;#39;re sure to be there when it does buzz. Just way too long of a wait to just stand and be in a heard like cattle. Another problem I have is the center seating are almost family style tables you&amp;#39;re literally closer to someone you don&amp;#39;t know on your left or right than you are with your date directly across in front of you. It is quite loud and you have to raise your voice to hear Each other, fortunately we had a end table up against one of the center walls so we weren&amp;#39;t as crowded. \u00a0Sorry for the dark photos, the Restraunt has such poor lighting that we had a hard time reading our menu as well.", "rating": 3, "date": "2/21/2020"}, {"text": "Disappointed in the customer service response when I called in to change my appointment time.

Our original plan was to go to Romio&amp;#39;s, but my Birthday landed on a Sunday this year...I know, yawwwwn! Next year...MONDAY! ugh lol.<br&gt;Romio&amp;#39;s was closed and apparently is now closed every Sunday...but whatever!

They suck you in, get you hooked, then they switch shit up ALL KINDS of crazy too and then....they don&amp;#39;t think customers notice...OR maybe they do and just don&amp;#39;t give a shit \u00a0haha! <br&gt;I know many reading this, love that place and don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I just LIKE it now.

Go to The Cheesecake Factory! SO delicious! I tried the crispy fried cheese, mac &amp;amp; cheese burger, and white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. My husband had a pepperoni pizza. They also give you warm bread and butter.<br&gt;<br&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my thoughts on the food: the complimentary bread and butter was very yummy! I tried a couple bites and was hooked. I ate too much because I couldn&amp;#39;t help it! The crispy fried cheese and marinara was PERFECT. Seriously amazing. Delicious blend of spices and the cheese was extremely melty, creamy, and hot. No room for improvement, they were just wonderful. The mac and cheese burger was also delicious. The burger itself had great flavor and was cooked well. It was very juicy, which is a must for a good burger. I loved the toasted buns, too. It comes with onions/lettuce/tomatoes etc on the side, but I didn&amp;#39;t put anything on it. I wanted the full taste of the burger. I will say that the strong (but yummy) flavor of the burger basically overpowers the taste of the fried mac and cheese, so it&amp;#39;s not very obvious that you&amp;#39;re even eating mac and cheese too. The extra cheese sauce they drizzle on it is flavorful though, and just having the mac and cheese on it contributes to the juiciness of the whole thing. I&amp;#39;m glad I ordered it because it was a very good burger! But next time if I ordered I wouldn&amp;#39;t bother wasting the calories on the extra mac and cheese since it&amp;#39;s not really that noticeable. It&amp;#39;s more about how good their burger is on it&amp;#39;s own! The fries that come with it are good, but not amazing. The white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake was absolutely delicious. I loved it so much. I was absolutely stuffed from the other food and still couldn&amp;#39;t get enough. My husband said the pepperoni pizza was good. Not anything particularly special, though.<br&gt;<br&gt;As far as the service, it was great. The restaurant was busy, but beautiful to look at (if quite darkly lit). A couple of negative things did happen, due to human error. The lady who brought our food to the table accidentally tipped my husband&amp;#39;s platter so that one of his slices of pizza slipped onto her arm. She apologized and they made it up by bringing extra pizza to the table. At the end, our waiter accidentally brought the wrong receipt and we didn&amp;#39;t read it carefully enough, paying an extra $10 for our meal. He stopped us on our way out to apologize and correct the mistake. These things were really no big deal, and the only reason I mention them at all is because I find that in reviews people often find any excuse to be angry with an establishment. We didn&amp;#39;t let silly things ruin our night. We had a great time at The Cheesecake Factory. They brought our food quickly, our waiter was friendly and consistent with checking in, and we of course loved the food.

No. It&amp;#39;s Idaho. <br&gt;<br&gt;First we ordered the Crispy Crab wontons as an appetizer. I should have assumed that a restaurant that had everything from Chinese to Mexican would be a jack of all trades and a king of none... The wontons themselves were flavorless and chunky. Not what I look for when I&amp;#39;m eating a cream cheese and crab wonton. The dough was cooked too long so it had a slightly burnt taste too it and it was way too thick to begin with. The sauce was really runny and was not sweet and sour but more of a soy sauce and sweet...not tasty. <br&gt;<br&gt;For dinner I ordered the Pasta Carbonara and a side salad with ranch. My salad came out with the &amp;#34;wontons&amp;#34; and the salad was wet. They had pre-dressed the salad too so all the dressing was runny and the leafs were all soggy...all I kept thinking was &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m spending $6 on a salad that I could have made for 25cents at home..and it would be tastier.&amp;#34;....sad thoughts. <br&gt;<br&gt;Next....the Carbonara...sigh. What a disappointment. The sauce was like water. I know why they give you a spoon...it&amp;#39;s so you can pick up the milky watery sauce from the bottom of the bowl and spoon it over the pasta...yum...*sarcasm*. The pasta was cooked well but there was no flavor but fat coming through to me. It just tasted horrendous. <br&gt;<br&gt;My friend ordered the Garlic Noodles upon recommendation from our server. YUCK. I was so grossed out by the flavor profile of this. It was like eating the remnants of an old gym sock. Oh and also - if no one tells you, when you order chicken on your pasta, there will be bones. No one told us this.

She offered to bring more but at this time I was full and did not want a load of potatoes brought to me I was finished with my meal. She tried to provide something else soup or salad but as I mentioned I was full. She said well I will talk to the manager we need to do something about this. Totally her idea. Before I knew it the manager arrived and she even said I saw those they were hard as a rock that&amp;#39;s not how they should be. She had took it upon herself to comp my breakfast for me which I did not expect. I have to say that this aggressive move to make sure I was a happy customer really got my attention.

Yes it&amp;#39;s chain food, and yes it&amp;#39;s probably not the healthiest choice out there.

It was obvious that she enjoys the fact that her job brings a new set of people to her every hour, and it was very apparent that she sees it as an opportunity to make a new set of friends for that time. She was very helpful, happy to be there, and as our meal went on, very personable and conversational. Not your typical &amp;#34;How you doing, ready to order, how&amp;#39;s the food, thanks for coming&amp;#34; that you&amp;#39;d expect from a place like this.

Both dinners were served in a very timely manner and were perfectly prepared. The food was hot and attractive in appearance. The meals were both delicious. And, there is a LOT of food.<br&gt;<br&gt;Now for the real treat. Again, following J.K.&amp;#39;s advice, we asked if Amy was working when we came in. She was and we asked to be seated in her station. We were escorted to a table for two. Amy appeared promptly and is everything J.K. described. We told her about her celebrity status on Yelp and she was quite surprised. After we were seated, it became obvious that there was a party of 10 to be seated right next to us. Amy suddenly appeared and asked if we would like to move to a booth instead. Given my hearing difficulties, that was an offer too good to refuse. She immediately bussed the just vacated booth and moved us over. Everything about Amy is just as J.K. stated. She is a first rate server and a real credit to CCF. I don&amp;#39;t know about any other CCF servers since this was our first visit, but I would love to encounter Amy at every restaurant we visit. Thanks, Amy. And if anyone from CCF is visiting this site, find Amy and clone her. She is truly a treasure.", "rating": 4, "date": "5/28/2010"}]}
