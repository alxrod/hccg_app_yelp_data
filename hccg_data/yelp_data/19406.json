I totally understand that COVID makes everything a lot more difficult and they looked swamped with takeout orders, but they seemed to lack any type of concrete plan for distributing takeout orders. We arrived a few minutes after our quoted time for our order time and we kept getting several different directions on how to get our order. No one seemed to know what was going on. My biggest complaint was how rude the host was (there was a temporary switch to a very nice host, but then the rude one came right back). We didn&amp;#39;t end up receiving our order for about 20 minutes, the food was cold, and was missing an order of fries.

What a worldwin of a night. Today at approximately 12:17 I received a text from my deathly ill friend Raphael who asked me to spend one of his last meals with him. Raphy explained to me that he had been craving some TCF recently and let me tell you... I LOVE a good dinner at the factory... I had to pick Raphael up because he can no longer drive. When I picked him up, he had the worlds brightest smile on his face, it lit up my life. That smile alone made me know that both God AND Jesus are looking down on us now (Isaiah 43:2). Anyway, we arrived at the factory and were granted the most luxurious handie capped spot right front and center, as it should be. We entered the premises and were immediately greeted by the most wonderful and kind hostess. She seated us immediately (I can only assume she did this because she saw the condition of my good friend Raphael). We sat down on arguably one of the most comfortable booths I have ever sat at, with a lovely view of the parking lot. Funny enough, I watched a lady drop her pasta while eating my dinner that I will get to now. I ordered a fettuccini Alfredo and my friend ordered a loose soup. He loves loose soup.

Just a rant.<br&gt;<br&gt;The issue with this restaurant is the back of the house, not the front.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Beet and Goat Cheese salad was tasty. I liked it a lot. Thought the dressing a tad too sweet, however.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and subbed broccoli for the mash and asparagus. Let&amp;#39;s start with the fact that I was deep inside the large booth. So I took the plate from the server so he didn&amp;#39;t need to reach. The bottom of the plate was filthy (I don&amp;#39;t want to think what was under my food). The food cold and tasteless. And the entr\u00e9es for our two booths came out at completely separate times over 15 minutes. We had three tables and three checks, two different servers. I would have expected each individual table to be served at the same time. Not over 15 minutes start to finish.<br&gt;<br&gt;I get it. Large short order restaurant at a mall. Menu way too large for any potential efficiency. Get as many people in and out of the restaurant as quickly as possible to boost head count and revenue. Here&amp;#39;s a thought... Serve 75% of the head count properly with a slimmer menu and great quality to protect your brand and increase your per capita. Or have the back of the house serve everyone that comes coldly with poor quality and boost your short term revenue killing your brand. I know what Cheesecake Factory chose.<br&gt;<br&gt;My first experience with Cheesecake Factory was over 20 years ago in the Inner Harbor of Baltimore and great experiences. Since they&amp;#39;ve opened a few in the Philly area, I was a promoter. My last few visits to King of Prussia and Willow Grove leave me avoiding altogether.

First I went in to get a slice of cheesecake. Cheesecakes that were supposed to be refrigerated were not in the case. This should have alerted me. I ordered a piece of the celebration cheesecake which I&amp;#39;ve had before at the Newark location without any problems as it tasted fresh and cold like a good cheesecake should. This one wasn&amp;#39;t but I&amp;#39;ll get to that. For starters, the crew was poorly organized, I had to wait over 10 minutes and my cake was on the counter for at least 4-5 minutes before the bakery assistant sloppily handed it over because she was having a conversation with a male employee who looked like a manager or supervisor. I finally got my cheesecake with the fork being tossed in the bag. Service was lackluster at best at that moment. It gets worse. <br&gt;<br&gt;Then I tried it. Gross doesn&amp;#39;t even begin to describe. We had eaten at the Newark location earlier without any issues this morning ($54 check). Service was exemplary. But here at KOP while we were running errands, grabbing a dessert was a nightmare with pisspoor service. So back to the cheesecake. The cake was warm and actually tasted not fully done or under-baked. It did not taste fresh at all. <br&gt;<br&gt;My husband offered to take it back because I was taking care of our newborn outside and he came out saying the bakery manager Scott was rude and wouldn&amp;#39;t return it claiming we ate half, which we didn&amp;#39;t. He repeated himself 3 times unnecessarily, questioned my husband&amp;#39;s character/integrity and showed no consideration or even listened as to what the problem was. <br&gt;<br&gt;I mean seriously? You would think as a bakery manager that you would care about food not being up to par and care about the customer experience??? So thanks Scott for being the reason we will never eat there again. You really should learn better management and baking techniques. The least you could have done would have been to investigate the issue or treated your loyal patrons with respect and dignity. <br&gt;<br&gt;Patrons don&amp;#39;t eat the celebration cake today 10/13, there is something wrong with it.", "rating": 1, "date": "10/13/2018"}, {"text": "I have never been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. <br&gt;<br&gt;I will say that the cheesecake is excellent.

She said &amp;#34;a few minutes&amp;#34; for one piece of cheese cake once again. I had more time today although I was frustrated of her comment &amp;#34;a few minutes&amp;#34; over one cake to go order. I was going to time it.

Unfortunately, it was virtually on top of the table next to ours as well. At least it enabled us to become friendly with the foursome to our side.<br&gt;<br&gt;We waited about 10 minutes for a waiter to finally come over. Once he did, we requested water, which we had not yet received. My friend ordered a half bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne, because she was in a bad mood and decided to splurge, even though the half bottle cost more than a full bottle at a store. The waiter then told us that they don&amp;#39;t have half bottles, but my friend pointed it out on the menu. Despite their very poor beer list, they did have Stone IPA in bottles. \u00a0So I ordered one of those. The waiter returned about five minutes later with the half bottle of champagne and a bucket to keep it chilled as well as my beer.<br&gt; <br&gt;My friend and I decided to split an order of nachos for an appetizer, and I ordered a hamburger medium rare you know why she ordered a chicken dish for our entrees. I have to admit the nachos were surprisingly good. They seemed very fresh with lots of cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. I ended up eating more of them that I had expected. However, they were the best part of the meal.<br&gt;<br&gt;Unfortunately, our entrees were not nearly as good as the nachos. My burger, which again, I had ordered medium rare, was well done. It was dry and relatively tasteless. It was also not brought with the condiments I had requested on the side. It also came with a very small side of fries. I was just not in the mood to send it back and wait for another one though. My friend&amp;#39;s chicken, which I did not taste since I don&amp;#39;t eat chicken, was cold and tasteless. She said it was cooked, but cold. At least I could order another Stone IPA and she could enjoy her champagne. <br&gt; <br&gt;For dessert, we split the &amp;#34;ADAM&amp;#39;S PEANUT BUTTER CUP FUDGE RIPPLE CHEESECAKE (Creamy Cheesecake Swirled with Caramel, Peanut Butter, Butterfingers\u00ae and Reese&amp;#39;s\u00ae Peanut Butter Cups.)&amp;#34; It was good, but not great. It kind of tasted like it had come out of a box.<br&gt; <br&gt;Overall the service was pretty good.

There are so many different flavors \u00a0and textures at work: Oreo cookies baked into the creamy cheesecake add a nice textural contrast, pillowy fudge cake that tastes like the cocoa-y cookie, Oreo mousse, milk chocolate icing that teeters on too sweet, and garnished with the familiar crunch of freshly-crumbled Oreos.<br&gt;<br&gt;Dutch Caramel Apple Streusel Cheesecake - 4.5 out of 5<br&gt;This cake is a cross between a luscious cheesecake and the best apple crumble ever, which is a winning combination in my book.<br&gt;<br&gt;Key Lime Cheesecake - 4.5 out of 5<br&gt;This cake has a very pronounced tart flavor that cuts the richness of the cake. Every bite is increasingly addictive and leaves you wanting more. The sweetness enrobes the tip of your tongue and the creaminess captures all of your taste buds, leaving the faint taint of fresh lime and tartness to refresh your palate. The macaroon crust is a nice departure from the pedestrian graham cracker.<br&gt;<br&gt;Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake - 2 out of 5<br&gt;I&amp;#39;d hoped that this would be my favorite cheesecake, but it was quite disappointing as it tasted too artificial.

Anyway, I usually get the OREO Cheesecake because I love cookies-n-cream ice cream, and this tastes just like it to me. But, I&amp;#39;m counting calories now so I went down the list and choose the cheesecake that had the least amount of calories (excluding the low-carb options, because it&amp;#39;s sweetened with Splenda and I don&amp;#39;t like artificial sweeteners). I ended up going with the Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake. It was 734 calories of cheesecake awesomeness. I only intended to eat half of it (counting calories, remember?), but I ate the whole thing. The best part was the bottom layer of raspberry vanilla cake (yummy). But once you taste the lemon cheesecake, it gets even better. Needless to say, it is now my new favorite. Sorry OREO&amp;#39;s :(<br&gt;<br&gt;Disclaimer: Due to my healthy eating habits, I do not know if the cheesecake was actually as good as stated, or if it&amp;#39;s just been so long since I&amp;#39;ve eaten cheesecake that it just tasted that much better.

It was literally the only thing I ate all day long, and I still wound up throwing some of it away that night. And I can eat!! Everything is huge there. The furniture, the silverware, the plants, the plates, the drinks, even the bathrooms. I can practically rest my chin on the table when I&amp;#39;m in a booth. It&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re Alice in Wonderland. It&amp;#39;s disconcerting, like the place is trying to make you feel tiny so you think you can eat more.

Here&amp;#39;s why: Every time I go to a Cheesecake Factory, whether it&amp;#39;s in TX, PA, NJ, or elsewhere, I always order the same thing. Since they don&amp;#39;t have a beef burrito on the menu, I ask them to make me a steak and put that in the burrito instead of the chicken, which I don&amp;#39;t care for. Since the steak is the more expensive of the two, they always just charge me for the price of the steak meal and everybody is happy. Well, on my last trip to the King of Prussia location, which consequently will be my last trip ever to the King of Prussia location, the waiter informed me that they would have to charge me full price for both meals - the burrito and the steak - even though I was only substituting the steak for the chicken and keeping all else the same. I asked to speak to the manager, who came out. I explained to her that this is what I always do every time I eat at a Cheesecake Factory and have even done so at that location on more than 1 occasion. She insisted that I pay full price for both items - around $50 - just to get the steak burrito. I told her that was ridiculous and that she was about to lose a customer forever. She shrugged her shoulders as if she didn&amp;#39;t care so I put a 5 on the table for the sodas and we went to Maggiano&amp;#39;s. If ever a manager needed fired, it&amp;#39;s the blond woman at the King of Prussia Cheesecake Factory.
