If you want to watch what your eating I recommend looking at their &amp;#34;skinnylicious&amp;#34; menu. Everything on it is under 600 calories.<br&gt;<br&gt;By far my favorite menu item is the Chicken Madiera. Its a one the cheesecake factory staples and is enough for two people to split. I would compare it to a sweetish Chicken Marsala. It comes with cheese over top and asparagus which adds a nice bit of bitterness to the otherwise sweet dish. The Pasta Napoletana is also good, though perhaps a bit overwhelmed by all the ingredients. Normally I eat the Pasta Da Vinci if I have pasta there, though its pretty much just the Chicken Madiera with pasta. I&amp;#39;d stay away from their steaks if you are picky. They aren&amp;#39;t bad but I wouldn&amp;#39;t consider them the best. As far as cheesecakes go, they are good but extremely rich.

Extra sauce? Sure. Cook with oil instead of butter? Definitely. Generally the staff is really friendly and knowledgeable, but if they don&amp;#39;t know, they&amp;#39;ll ask. <br&gt;<br&gt;My normal choices are the 4 cheese pasta (without cheese), or the old fashioned burger with a gluten free bun.

Based on our experience, I think it likely that in the future we will make a special trip to Des Moines just to eat here.<br&gt;<br&gt;Soon after being seated, our cokes came along with a basket of very good bread and butter. I had the crusty French bread, which appeared to be part of a bagette, and my wife had what looked like some kind of oat bread that she thought was very good. A second basket was cheerfully provided upon request at no extra charge. <br&gt;<br&gt;I had the chicken parmesan &amp;#34;pizza style&amp;#34; (it should really be spelled &amp;#34;chicken parmigiana&amp;#34;) , which is an unusual dish: chicken is pounded until it is very thin, shaped into a disc, then breaded and served with melted cheese and tomato sauce. It comes out looking like a pizza, with the &amp;#34;crust&amp;#34; being the chicken, with a large ball of pasta sitting on top of it. It was delicious, and didn&amp;#39;t suffer from a problem that I have had with chicken parmigiana in the past, which is too-thick chicken. The portion was huge; the disc covered an entire plate. My wife had the chicken Riesling, which she also loved: this was chicken with Riesling white wine cream sauce, along with bacon, onions and mushrooms. I had a few bites of her meal and agree that it was excellent. I&amp;#39;m not a mushroom fan and was glad to see that it had more bacon than mushrooms; my wife would have preferred it the other way. Her portion was also generous, though not as huge as mine; we both took about half home for leftovers. <br&gt;<br&gt;We also splurged and split a dessert, Linda&amp;#39;s fudge cake. Chocolate cake lovers will enjoy this: multiple layers of excellent chocolate cake with fudge frosting on top and between the layers, served with an extra-large dollop of whipped cream. Although we both loved it, we also couldn&amp;#39;t finish it and wound up taking about half of it home, too. We both agree that in the future, given the quantity of food that is served here, we&amp;#39;ll probably skip dessert, but we were curious about it and wanted to try it this time. Photos of our entrees and dessert, courtesy of my wife, are attached.<br&gt;<br&gt;On the basis of the food and waitress quality alone, I would likely give this restaurant five stars, but three circumstances conspired to knock the rating down one star. First was a timeliness issue. We arrived a few minutes after the restaurant opened and although there were still many open tables, we had to wait about four or five minutes to be seated. (A word to the wise: when we left at about 12:30, the place was already mobbed; this was on a Saturday afternoon and perhaps the restaurant is not that crowded on a weekday.) The brief wait to be seated was not that big a deal, but, after ordering, we also had to wait quite a while for our meals, to the point where our waitress told us that she would check to see where the food was.<br&gt;<br&gt;My second quibble concerns the size of the restrooms. They seem too small for a restaurant of this size and mealtime population, and indeed the ladies&amp;#39; room had substantial lines when my wife used it. I suspect that people from Jordan Creek Mall who were not dining here were coming in to use the restrooms. <br&gt;<br&gt;Finally, there is the price. Our entrees ($14.50 for mine, $13.95 for my wife&amp;#39;s) were not cheap but did not seem unreasonably expensive, but our dessert seemed a bit high at $8.50 and our cokes, at $3.25 each, were probably the most expensive beverages I&amp;#39;ve had in any restaurant in recent memory. All told our lunch, with tax and tip, cost almost $55, which seems rather high for central Iowa.

Few times that we came here, there was always a long wait which we thought that it might be a good thing. Few more visit, it was just plain horrible and one time we just decided to just leave and go somewhere else. One time we came here for one of my friend&amp;#39;s birthday since there were more than 6 in our group, we tried to see if we can make the reservation but no luck. The most recent visit was a few weeks ago since we were all craving for cake, we came here to get some Craigs carrot cake, Red Velvet cake, or whatever they have really. There was no line at the take-out area. We have told the guy what we wanted to get and to our surprise it took them 20 minutes to put a cake in a box. Yes, it was 20mins and we not even exaggerating. When we ask how long will it take we always get &amp;#34;in a bit&amp;#34;. \u00a0That was 20 minute for something that I was looking at through refrigerated pastry case. My daughter asked to go to the bathroom and came back, still no cake. When I was about to leave the lady called out my name, paid for it and left. It was just horrible. To be fair, we did like their Louisianna Chicken, though they put way too much sauce.<br&gt;<br&gt;We came home and ate the cake. It was not the same carrot cake that I like. I don&amp;#39;t remember it being too moist or tasting so differently. The cake was not fluffy as well. Same as with the red velvet. We just \u00a0threw it away coz it tasted nasty. I mean Village Inn would probably be better just get something from the grocery. Yeah, I don&amp;#39;t see us coming back here anytime soon. Bring some flashlight to see your food as well.
