She got my name down and said she&amp;#39;ll let the Manager know to text me soon. Waited another 15 mins and still nothing.

On any given Friday night, you&amp;#39;re probably looking at a guaranteed wait, anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes to get a table...<br&gt;<br&gt;...And I just don&amp;#39;t understand why.<br&gt;<br&gt;Simply put, I am not a fan. I still remember vividly today that years ago, I was served a entree of chicken parmesan at this very same location that was so exceedingly salty, I had to send it back. Thankfully, the restaurant did not charge me, (and I thank the staff for such great service,) but this less than pleasant experience had prevented me from venturing back to this eatery for years and years.<br&gt;<br&gt;And yet, here I was just a few nights ago, thinking I would give it another chance. A little date night at TCF. Sigh. Spoiler alert: it wasn&amp;#39;t the greatest decision. It certainly was not impressive to either me or my significant other.<br&gt;<br&gt;To cut the story short: the food *still* sucks here.<br&gt;<br&gt;And I am not talking about mildly unacceptable. It&amp;#39;s actually grossly repulsive, especially considering the quality that this name brand should carry, and its corresponding price tags.<br&gt;<br&gt;Well, let&amp;#39;s walk you through this anyway.<br&gt;<br&gt;First, the complimentary bread came in two variety: a brown one and a sour dough type of bread. The brown one tasted very good; it went very well with their savory butter, and it was easily one of the best parts of our meals. Quite sad indeed.<br&gt;<br&gt;The appetizer, the crab bites, cost us $8, and was nothing spectacular. It&amp;#39;s a miniature version of crab cakes kinda, but it&amp;#39;s essentially crab meat rolled into balls then deep fried. There&amp;#39;s nothing sophisticated about its execution or presentation, and you simply drench them in lemon juice, dip them into a tartar sauce, and enjoy. It tasted fine, but it isn&amp;#39;t something you can&amp;#39;t easily whip up at home, and it&amp;#39;s way too overpriced at $8. I&amp;#39;d skip it, had I known.<br&gt;<br&gt;The entrees, however, were criminally expensive for the value (or lack thereof) we received. I ordered the truffle honey chicken, the better of the two choices, and my bf ordered the chicken bellagio, which I highly recommend *against* selecting.<br&gt;<br&gt;My meal, the truffle honey chicken, was mostly redeemed by the delicious mixture of sweet honey and irresistible aroma of truffle oil, served alongside with pieces of respectably fried chicken. But let&amp;#39;s be real, this is just fried chicken breasts dipped in a nice sauce or dressing. It isn&amp;#39;t that hard to mess up on, and it&amp;#39;d be great tasting no matter what: Fried stuff, plus honey, plus truffle? It&amp;#39;s a winner... almost.<br&gt;<br&gt;What convinced me that this was still an average product was the accompanying mashed potato (eh, it&amp;#39;s ok) and asparagus (terrible). I could cook better asparagus at home! Out of the 6 stalks of asparagus stingily placed on my plate, 5 of them had tough-to-chew bottoms... You know, the parts that should&amp;#39;ve been deemed too hard for most chefs (and their patrons), and therefore should be cut off, and not served? Yeah, they made their way to my plate. They really dropped the ball on that one.<br&gt;<br&gt;The other entree, the chicken bellagio, was an even bigger fail. It&amp;#39;s composed of 3 parts--pasta, chicken, and salad with prosciutto. The salad was fine. The chicken was a little dry, but passable, and seasoned quite sufficiently. The pasta, the main carb of the dinner, was unforgivably overcooked. It was dry as heck, without flavor, and an outright sin to retail restaurants. I am a pretty terrible cook when it comes to cooking spaghetti at home. (It requires good timing.) And this was about the same specie of abomination I would conjure up. It was horrid.<br&gt;<br&gt;Come on, Cheesecake Factory!<br&gt;<br&gt;The entire bill came out to be around $55ish or higher, and my bf and I both felt there was no justification, I mean seriously, none at all, for TCF to be charging this level of payment for subpar, marginally inedible dishes.<br&gt;<br&gt;It was this bad years ago, and it&amp;#39;s still this bad years from then. There&amp;#39;s no improvement whatsoever in my experience.<br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, the chefs were to blame. And if your business depends on FOOD to survive, that ain&amp;#39;t good news.<br&gt;<br&gt;The silver lining, if there was one, was that the portions were generous enough to match its prices. We had leftovers--leftovers that we weren&amp;#39;t excited to revisit, tbh, since the dinner was overall such an underwhelming experience.

So we decided to order food for pick up, instead of eating in the restaurant. <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered through their website on Yelp, and it said the estimated time for pick up was 35 minutes after the order. \u00a0We arrived there on the estimated pick up time at the restaurant. Food wasn&amp;#39;t ready but we paid the bill first and waited in front of their bakery spot where all pick up food is handed down to customers. <br&gt;<br&gt;We waited for more than 30 minutes. During the time, no one seemed to care about us or our order even though we were standing right in front of them. The bakery cashier and the dinning were both not busy that night. Other customers for pick up were waiting for so long as well. A lady who worked there brought someone&amp;#39;s pick up order and left it on the shelf next to the cashier for a while. I knew it was for one of us, but since we all were waiting in front of them, I automatically assumed that they would call the customer&amp;#39;s name if it&amp;#39;s ready to pick up. They didn&amp;#39;t call anyone. The food was still left there for a while, around 10 minutes. They didn&amp;#39;t look busy but just talking to each other. One customer asked whom the food was for. They checked the order and found out it was hers. This made me worry about their service. <br&gt;<br&gt;After this happened, because we already had been waiting for more than 30 minutes since the estimated pick up time, we asked them about our order. One of them immediately asked us, &amp;#34;oh you are the one who are waiting for cheese cake, right?&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;Again, we had been waiting right in front of them for more than 30 minutes and the cashier was not busy for the entire time. Not only they didn&amp;#39;t care about our order, but also they remembered our order incorrectly. They went to the kitchen, and came back to us immediately with our food, which was cold already. We could tell the food was left in the kitchen for a while. <br&gt;<br&gt;Well I know the estimated time for pick up is just &amp;#34;estimated&amp;#34; time, the actual time we can pick it up could be earlier or later than that, of course. But the estimated time was 35 minutes after the order plus we waited another 30 minutes at the restaurant. Of course, the food should be cold already by the time we could get it. If we needed to wait for so long, what is the point to pick it up instead of eating in? With this more than 1 hour, we could have finished eating somewhere outside quickly instead. <br&gt;<br&gt;If we pay around 45 dollars, I still expect better service even if we ordered them for pick up. <br&gt;<br&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t feel like paying that money for the cold food after such a long wait (beside we needed to drive back for another 15 minutes to eat them at home). We didn&amp;#39;t receive the food and asked them to refund. <br&gt;<br&gt;I know we were just unlucky that night.

This place is such a great restaurant for big family dinners. The only downside about any Cheesecake Factory restaurant is that there is always a long wait! Since this location is attached to the Santa Anita mall, average waits for lunch/dinner can vary from 40 minutes to an hour or so long. But the service here is always top notch. They bring your table your drinks immediately. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you go to Cheesecake Factory and you don&amp;#39;t get the brown bread, you are doing it all wrong!! I love how they come out with complimentary free bread, a sourdough and a molasses, sweet bread. They both come out hot and fresh, in a warm basket. I noticed that Cheesecake Factory does not give out individual packets of butter anymore, but give out tons of scooped out butter onto a small plate, which seems more cost efficient. <br&gt;<br&gt;Some dishes that I would recommend are the four cheese pasta and the pasta carbonara. The four cheese pasta is just ooey gooey with cheeses and has a slight tomato taste to it. Nothing overpowers each other. The pasta carbonara is great too because it&amp;#39;s creamy and has bacon bits! I also love the fried mac and cheese balls here because it has a nice crunchy texture on the outside, but is filled with al dente mac and cheese. It&amp;#39;s not too cheesey and overpowering. They also have great salads and appetizers, such as the samosas and the filled mushrooms! All full of flavor. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m not really a fan of cheesecake (I know, shocking).

I first went to The Cheesecake Factory on Father&amp;#39;s Day after ordering online a strawberry cheesecake for my family. I made the drive 20 minutes to this location and upon arrival, I had to wait in 2 separate lines. One to get into the restaurant and another at the bakery to retrieve my cake. Upon showing the bakery worker my online order I was told that my cake was sold out for the day. The first mistake is the fact that The Cheesecake Factory does not update its online ordering system. I wasted both my time and money going to pick up an order that wasn&amp;#39;t completed, and for some reason, no one thought to contact me and tell me that it was all out of stock. After speaking to the manager, I was told I would be refunded and although I was disappointed, I went on my way. <br&gt;<br&gt;Fast forward almost 3 weeks later, I check my bank statement to see that I was charged for a $30 cheesecake on Father&amp;#39;s Day that I never received. Upon discovering the charge, I promptly spoke to a manager (Daniel) at The Cheesecake Factory via phonecall. He told me to come back to the store for a refund, and I don&amp;#39;t think this man understands that we&amp;#39;re in a pandemic, I live over 20 minutes away, and it&amp;#39;s not necessarily convenient for me to be traveling for a REFUND THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF. I ask for the Santa Anita Cheesecake Factory email to attempt to have the refund done via email, and I was placed on hold for a few minutes only for him to refer me to the CHEESECAKE FACTORY WEBSITE that does NOT have the emails for individual locations. So.. not only does the manager at this location not know how to do refunds CORRECTLY, but they don&amp;#39;t know how to help customers complete refunds via online and expect patrons to just be traveling back and forth in the middle of a pandemic. <br&gt;<br&gt;I felt distraught at the fact that The Cheesecake Factory was trying to rip me off and if I had never checked my bank statement that day, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have realized that I was wrongly charged for food I didn&amp;#39;t receive.

I usually get this during the day along with my appetizers. Love the mint leaves <br&gt;<br&gt;Before I had diabetes (2017), I always get their strawberry cheesecake!! It&amp;#39;s the best! And I would order one for here and one to go haha. <br&gt;<br&gt;Most of all, I love the experience here. Wonderful customer service, all the waiters are really super nice except what they are super busy during happy hours.

This was more palatable than the overly sweet bang bang chicken but the sauce was way too strong, and again tasted like syrup and coconut milk poured atop coconut flavored rice. <br&gt;<br&gt;Smokehouse burger - bun was burnt to a crisp and extra smoky. &amp;#39;nuff said.

I hope there&amp;#39;s no character limit as to how much I can write. In all honesty my family and I love Cheesecake Factory but on our visit this latest time we were with friends that just came in to town and I was really disappointed with quite a few things since we love how this place was consistently in the past. <br&gt;<br&gt;First thing I noticed when we were lead to our table for lunch was the cleanliness of the table and the dishes and silverware. It was like the night crew just used a dirty rag to clean because there was crumbs all over and sticky table. The bread dishes had food stuck on 6 out of 7 dishes, that is bad. I understand 1 or perhaps 2 but 6?! Really was the dish washing machine broken or the dinner crew that slammed the night before that they stacked plates thinking it was clean? The silverware was much better just a few forks were crusted and sticky. I didn&amp;#39;t notice what letter grade they received but hopefully not a C. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now on to the food and drinks which were all very good, with the exception that when a child orders a simple butter Parmesan bow tie pasta you figure it&amp;#39;s hard to mess that up, but yep the pasta station messed up in the back, there was a few \u00a0green onions that got in and a smudge of marinara sauce that dripped in and got served. Um this would be bad if someone has food allergies with either the ingredients of marinara or green onions, luckily my kid doesn&amp;#39;t, but doesn&amp;#39;t like either of the accidentally included bonus ingredients. We ended sending it back because what was included was enough to change the flavor of the dish that my child wouldn&amp;#39;t eat it. You figure it would be quick to get a fresh one out, um no we were almost all done before it got out to her. Wow that&amp;#39;s really amazing. <br&gt;<br&gt;When we were looking for our waitress the few times we needed help, no where to be found. Waited quite a bit of time. I understand we came at that start of the weekend lunch rush but it&amp;#39;s really bad to be not available to your guests, I figure it maybe the decision poor grouping of who takes care of which stations because I didn&amp;#39;t see out wait staff really attending anyone else around us. She was pleasant and nice but if she was tasked to help our line table and other tables else where of course I wouldn&amp;#39;t assume she&amp;#39;s be close to us, she would be all over the place. That is poor management of table groupings for the poor server.<br&gt;<br&gt;The adult drinks were done really well, we had a few between us and our friends and they were all mixed quite solid. The food over all was very good. The other thing I was concerned about was the amount of salt that was used in the French onion soup, wow I used my sandwich to help cut the salt and it balance out better but I just left that ocean in its bowl. I think it was saltier than the Saltons Sea down in imperial county, it was so salty. The salad was good, fresh and tasty. I had the chicken salad sandwich combo with salad and soup. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;Over all experience was not what I expected from an older seasoned establishment as this. I hope it was just a one time deal. I will be back again to see if things changed.<br&gt;<br&gt;New edit...9-18-2016<br&gt;So The mother ship aka corporate reached out and asked me to address my concerns to their corporate site. \u00a0will do over and out so I bring back 1 star but I need to send in yet another written letter of addressing my experience? Ok that&amp;#39;s a bit much if they can&amp;#39;t read my review here and figure something is up. Not being a brat or a complainer but just stating facts of what I experienced and hope the branch fixes it. Last couple times I&amp;#39;ve been there have been eh just ok not blow my mind wow the experience was awesome. I guess experience goes out the door when you have too many people waiting for a table and you care less.<br&gt;<br&gt;Latest Edit 9-24-2016<br&gt;Ok guest services addresses me again, glad they are now taking me seriously and taking it internal. After it takes initial and edited post to get it this far wow. People don&amp;#39;t think to take it serious after the first review. Uncleanliness is unacceptable period and if it takes 1 review and 1 edit to get it addressed then there is some breakdown in communication.

The meal arrived, with no artichoke appetizer. I called Cheesecake. I was told artichoke is not in season, so they couldn&amp;#39;t fill it.

Cajun Jimbalya is usually very flavorful and spicy, but this time did not seem to fit all those categories. There were too much noodles and not enough flavor; bland.

The salad was fresh and plentiful with arugula and radicchio and the dressing with tangy and sweet also with a generous shaving of parmesan cheese. <br&gt;<br&gt;The chicken piccatta: the chicken steak was pound out thinly and with creamy sauce and spaghetti and a generous shaving of parmesan cheese. The spaghetti was soft and Al dente. Though Mom wasn&amp;#39;t a fan of this one since there wasn&amp;#39;t even sauce to mix the spaghetti with. I didn&amp;#39;t mind this one and it made for a nice lunch to take to work tomorrow. <br&gt;<br&gt;The avocado eggrolls: soft creamy avocados rolled into an egg roll and I dug it. Mom being the eggrolls making Queen giggle at this American creation, but she actually liked it as well. We both ate 3 each and saved two for me to take to lunch tomorrow. I loved the dipping sauce too - sweet pesto basil sauce, yum!<br&gt;<br&gt;Finally, the crew sang Happy Birthday to my mom with a cheesecake slice. (The cheesecake was light and creamy and mixed with chocolate sauce and whipped cream...O.M.G..yum!!!). Mom was blushing, but giggle and enjoyed the finale, lol!<br&gt;<br&gt;Service with Mickey was friendly and attentive and he packed up our leftovers for us. Overall, it was nice eating out at a different American restaurant. \u00a0Thanks again for Mom&amp;#39;s early Birthday lunch, Boss!", "rating": 5, "date": "4/23/2015"}, {"text": "Great ambiance, food ok and price a bit high for my taste.

My family and I been coming to Cheesecake Factory for years now and I have been getting good services except for this one recent visit we had. On July 2 my family and I went to Santa Anita Mall and after shopping my kids said &amp;#34;Mom, can we have dinner at Cheesecake Factory?&amp;#34; So I said sure!. We go there and I told the guy table for 4 please and he asked &amp;#34;Outside or Inside?&amp;#34; We all decided we wanted to eat outside and he said ok and gave us the buzzer for us to wait and was told 15 minutes wait. So we waited...waited...waited and after 25 mins of waiting our buzzer started buzzing so we gave it to the guy. He took the buzzer from my husband and was told just stay on the side. We waited again bout 5 minutes and finally the girl said &amp;#34;Let&amp;#39;s go this way&amp;#34;. We followed her and she took us to a table which it wasn&amp;#39;t outside like we told the guy but we all decided to just take that table because we were all hungry already. Another 5-7 minutes on the table Kalyn took drinks order then she came back with our drinks but without any straws so I asked her if we could have straws and she said &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;ll be back&amp;#34;. She came back with our straws and left right away. So we were waiting and waiting and waited again and hey guess who showed up after minutes of waiting? Yes, Kalyn decided to show up gave us 3 pcs of bread with 4 pcs of butter and took our orders. After she took our orders my daughter asked her if they have some type of wipes or hand sanitizer and she said &amp;#34;No but we have napkins. Would you like some?&amp;#34; My daughter said &amp;#34;Yes, please&amp;#34;. My daughter waited and waited and waited but she never came back. So by this time my head was already pounding from hunger. 25 minutes pass us sitting from our table another family sat by our table. She brought them 4 pcs of bread which they were only 3 but hey that cool by why we only got 3 pcs of bread which there was 4 of us? Anyway, she took their orders. Everyone happened so fast from the table next to us that their food even came first before us. We waited 40 minutes for our food!. So we ate and we ran out of drinks but she didn&amp;#39;t come back to us if we needed anything. After we wait we waited and waited and after 10 minutes she showed up and said &amp;#34;everything ok?&amp;#34; And my husband was like can we have more soda? And said for here or to go? We said to go cause it might take another 20 minutes. She came back with the soda to go which was only 3/4 she didn&amp;#39;t even fill it up. She asked if we want desserts and I said no we will just buy it at the front and she looked at me and gave me a fake smile. So she gave us the check and we gave her 2 Cheesecake Factory gift cards that was given to my kids both $25 each and the rest I told her to put in my debit card. 5 minutes later she came back and told us that one of the card didn&amp;#39;t have money and only one went through so I said just use my debit card for the rest so she left. She handed me the gift card that supposedly didn&amp;#39;t have any money that she said she ran twice. My husband and I was thinking why wouldn&amp;#39;t have the card any money? Anyway, she came back and gave me the receipt that I needed to sign and left. So we got up and decided to get desserts at the front and at the register where I was paying I asked the girl can you try if this gift card would work and she did. After she ran the card and it actually worked and she even said &amp;#34;You have $7.35 left&amp;#34; after she charged me with 2 Cheesecakes.

With a focus on the bottom line instead of great service experience it is obvious to the outside world that they only have 3 stars, when they should be a 5 star with rave reviews.

Other customers seemed to be complaining a lot about the service around us, we weren&amp;#39;t the only ones. Also brought it to the attention of the manager that there was no soap in the ladies bathroom, from the time we were there st 12:30, and still when we returned at about 3:00. His response was that there was soap, you just had to pump it a lot and it would come out. Folks, I pumped those damn things plenty of times and if there was soap, that was news to me. My thought was ok, if there&amp;#39;s soap that&amp;#39;s great. But if it&amp;#39;s that difficult to dispense, it&amp;#39;s doubtful that people will stand there and keep trying to pump out soap that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be coming out. Time to get new dispensers then. (My brain immediately thought of people who work there and prepare the food. No soap?! ) Cheesecake Factory, in my experience, has typically been a solid choice--the Marina del Rey and West LA locations have usually been ok.

The sauce complements the avocado very well. Moving on to the main dishes... I highly suggest the miso salmon for the healthy eaters out there. The salmon is cooked perfectly (almost) every time and the sauce is also an A+ with the rice on the bottom (choose brown rice if you want to be extra healthy). But on the days when I&amp;#39;m craving straight up pasta, I like to get the angel hair shrimp, which is just a huge plate of plain old angel hair and shrimp drenched in tomato sauce with a hint of garlic and lemon. The farfalle pasta is also a good option I go to if I&amp;#39;m not in the mood for angel hair.

I don&amp;#39;t even like eating at these sort of places but the other week a couple of friends and I were around the area and didn&amp;#39;t know where we could grab a quick bite. We went on our foursquare app and found out this Cheesecake Factory was offering a 20% off $50 discount so why not. Their pastas are decent right?<br&gt;<br&gt;Our dinner took longer than originally planned. It was the weekend so it was packed. We waited 30 minutes before we were seated but that&amp;#39;s fine, the hostess told us this when we asked to be put on the waiting list. But seriously, do people not have better places to eat at? I started off with their sour apple martini. I&amp;#39;m a sucker for appletinis. This had to be the worst appletini I&amp;#39;ve ever had in my life. It tasted decent enough, like their strawberry lemonade. But I ordered a martini. Where was the alcohol in here? I can understand them forgetting the vermouth but where was the vodka to the schnapp? Not to mention it was $12. I normally do not complain about drinks but seriously, a simple cocktail for that much? Especially when it&amp;#39;s obviously watered down? And the server had the audacity to ask if I wanted another one. Shakes my head.<br&gt;<br&gt;Moving on to the food. Started off with their avocado eggrolls. That dish is pretty darn good. Much better than their crab cakes. Then we had our entrees. I had the shrimp scampi with their diane steak combination. The shrimp scampi and mashed potatoes were decent enough I suppose. I actually like the scampi without the capellini. However the steak medallions was terrible. What wine sauce do they use to cook it with here? It clashed with the meat terribly. It was like they put an asian oyster sauce in hopes of marinating the beef but it came out as a fail. And the cooks here needs to learn what a medium steak looks like. It seems they have trouble with all types of meat because my friend&amp;#39;s meat loaf didn&amp;#39;t come out so great too.<br&gt;<br&gt;In summary, we were so dissatisfied we even bother trying one of their cheesecakes for desserts.

She (smartly) told me &amp;#34;No, you know you hate that place.&amp;#34; I insisted. &amp;#34;Maybe it will be ok&amp;#34; I thought to myself. Hey, the world just seems like a brighter and better place with her around. And Cheesecake sounded good anyway. I had never actually tried the cheesecake here. It seemed like a good night to do it. <br&gt;<br&gt;I felt like Macaroni and Cheese, and so did the GF. They don&amp;#39;t seem to have that here (the one thing that they DON&amp;#39;T actually have on their godforsaken menu), so I ordered the Five Cheese Pasta (with chicken) and she ordered the Macaroni and Cheeseburger, and we split them. The five cheese pasta was a flavorless mess, and the extra money for the chicken was not worth it. Once again, no surprise, another culinary failure from the Cheesecake Factory. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Macaroni and Cheeseburger is slightly better, but only just. The beef patty for the burger itself had a strange and none-too-pleasing flavor, but the fried Mac-N-Cheese patty was good. Hey, I guess even Cheesecake Factory can&amp;#39;t screw that up. Of course, those patties probably come to them frozen. Not hard to just dip them in a deep frier. <br&gt;<br&gt;So hey, dinner was a bit of a waste (well, a huge waste), but what about desert? The waiter brings the desert menu around and shows off thier featured cheesecake, a yummy looking oreo cookie concoction. I peruse the menu looking at the various cheescake selections, of wich there are quite a few. Then I notice the price, $6.95 - $7.95 per slice. What? Seriously? I asked the waiter if that was for like 1/4 of a cheesecake, and he said no, but that they are decent slices. I felt like telling him to go eff himself, but it wasn&amp;#39;t his fault, he doesn&amp;#39;t set the prices, and he was a nice guy who gave us good service, really the only upside to the night.<br&gt;<br&gt;As it was, the bill was $31.43 after tax but before tip, with no drinks, no appetizers, and no fucking overpriced Cheesecake. Just two lame-assed dinner entrees. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;So, seriously Cheesecake Factory, fuck you. I&amp;#39;m not kidding. I don&amp;#39;t like to be vulgar or crass or rude in my yelp reviews, but I have to do it this time. You guys suck ass, and furthermore, anyone who really likes this place doesn&amp;#39;t know a good meal from a hole in the ground. Again, I don&amp;#39;t like to get all snobby about my foody-ness, but I&amp;#39;m going to this time.

I&amp;#39;ve probably been here about four times with several different friends, and I always experienced attentive service and a clean environment. Because I was dining with just one other friend, we usually didn&amp;#39;t have to wait for too long to get seated (I think one exception was on a Saturday night for dinner, but that was during prime dinner time). Usually, I can count on being seated promptly (perks of dining in a small party). My great experiences at this Cheesecake Factory ensure my return if I&amp;#39;m ever at this mall or in the area. Though parking can sometimes be a pain (especially on the weekends or during holiday season), dining at this Cheesecake Factory has been mostly pleasant and hassle free.<br&gt; <br&gt;I think the most memorable experience I had at this Cheesecake Factory location was dining with a friend for a late lunch/early dinner one Sunday afternoon, and the eatery wasn&amp;#39;t too crowded. We ate at our leisure and I think we were actually in the restaurant for almost three hours total, just catching up, talking and having a good time. I love when dining experiences are memorable because of the company and because of the relaxing environment (would have been a totally different experience if we were rushed through our meal and the eatery was super crowded, as the Waikiki Cheesecake Factory always is).<br&gt; <br&gt;Here are some of my favorites when it comes to dining at the famous CF:<br&gt;<br&gt;&amp;#34;Fish &amp;amp; Chips&amp;#34;: My mom ordered this entr\u00e9e once for dinner and I had one of her fish pieces. I&amp;#39;m always on the lookout for a good fish &amp;amp; chips meal, so I&amp;#39;m glad I got to try this dish. It features hand-battered fillets that are fried crisp and served with cole slaw, French Fries and tartar sauce. The fish&amp;#39;s interior was moist and I did like the battered interior -- crispy, crunchy and buttery, but not overdone. I did like it enough to order it for my entr\u00e9e in the future, but the fish pieces were pretty small for the hefty price of the meal. If the fish pieces were bigger, it might be more worth it, but that price holds me back and keeps me sticking to my usual burger/sandwich entrees.<br&gt;<br&gt;&amp;#34;OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake&amp;#34;: Though I prefer the original version of this cheesecake (and want it to return), I was glad to try this slight rendition. This cheesecake differs from the original OREO one because it includes a layer of moist fudge cake and OREO cookie mousse atop the cheesecake. It&amp;#39;s similar to the original in that it has OREO cookies baked into the creamy layer of cheesecake and is topped with a milk chocolate icing. I had mixed feelings about this cheesecake and preferred the original just because I was not a huge fan of the mousse layer (I don&amp;#39;t like mousse in general ... nothing against this cheesecake). But, I really liked the layer of moist, fudgy chocolate cake interspersed with the layer of cheesecake (similar to my favorite &amp;#34;Reese&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter&amp;#34; cheesecake), and the OREO cookie chunks baked into the cheesecake itself is probably my favorite component of the entire dessert. If the mousse layer were eliminated, I would have no problem with this cheesecake being on the menu instead of the original OREO creation.<br&gt;<br&gt;&amp;#34;Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake&amp;#34;: \u00a0I have ordered this cheesecake once, and though it was good, I felt that for this version, the red velvet cake would have tasted better when separated from the cheesecake. This was a combo that actually shouldn&amp;#39;t have combined the two delicacies. I did like the red velvet cake, but felt that the cake itself could have been more moist. However, that cream cheese frosting was amazing and gave the drier cake some redemptive quality. I did like the Original Cheesecake as well, but again, it would have been better not to mix the two. At least I did get to try this red velvet fantasy. I still really like red velvet, but would have preferred this cake solo for dessert (or the cheesecake solo ... either or, not both at once).<br&gt;<br&gt;&amp;#34;Godiva Chocolate Brownie Sundae&amp;#34;: My friend told me that she ordered an ice cream sundae from TCF before because the brownies were superb, so I might have to order one for myself to see what she&amp;#39;s talking about. This sundae features a rich Godiva chocolate brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream and toasted almonds. Since the brownie is Godiva, I believe it when my friend said that this was one of the best brownies she&amp;#39;s ever tasted.

Don&amp;#39;t get the nacho&amp;#39;s for happy hour, chicken is extra!<br&gt;<br&gt;4. Lunch specials til 5 PM!<br&gt;<br&gt;5.

But regardless, I have some key dishes that my family swears by when we head to Cheesecake:<br&gt;<br&gt;- The factory burrito -- a fat burrito, topped with cheese and chili verde sauce and filled with white rice, onions, corn, tomatoes, and chicken. Also comes with a side of sour cream and guacamole! I would suggest extra chili verde sauce!<br&gt;<br&gt;- The jambalaya -- My mom loves it, though I&amp;#39;m sure most people will agree they have had better!<br&gt;<br&gt;- Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad -- This salad is amazing. It&amp;#39;s like a southwest chicken salad to begin with, but you add onion strings and barbecue sauce and ranch! It&amp;#39;s so good and the portion is huge! Highly recommend for the deal during lunch hours, only $10!<br&gt;<br&gt;- The White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake -- absolutely tremendous cheesecake. SO good. But so expensive........... I remember a few years back when they had a free piece for cheesecake day.... but I digress!

The server was nice enough, even helping to pour the ketchup for us (the secret is to hit the &amp;#34;57&amp;#34; on the bottle). But since he already earned his 18% gratuity due to our large group, he probably wasn&amp;#39;t as attentive as he could have been. <br&gt;<br&gt;The menu is extensive, which is probably part of the appeal of the Cheesecake Factory, everything from pasta to comfort food to Asian dishes. \u00a0I&amp;#39;ve been there many times and have yet to even try a quarter of the menu. But first came the bread and drinks. The strawberry lemonade is delicious - not as good as Red Robins (who puts actual strawberries in the drink). It was pricey at almost five dollars but still managed to hit the spot. And one of my favorite parts of the meal is the dark bread (rye?). I could pretty much live on that bread. One downside is that the food took awhile to come out so I filled up on the bread, lemonade and their free refills. I ended up getting a pizzette from their new small plate and snacks menu ($3.95 -$6.50), which are advertised as appetizers and I think just the right size if you want a light lunch. Or in my case, because I wanted to save room for cheesecake. The rest of the group got a variety of pastas and sandwiches off the lunch special menus. The portions are still ginormous and the presentation of the food was very nice too. \u00a0The pizzette was good - thin crust with sausage and ricotta cheese, not too oily with about 5 small slices. Then I ordered the 30th anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake. It was definitely rich with four layers of chocolate, fudge, cheese and heaven but so amazing. Yeah so much good food and I still ended up taking half of my pizza and cheesecake home. I also got to try the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake, which was yummy as well. Although I haven&amp;#39;t eaten many kinds of cheesecake I haven&amp;#39;t liked. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, a pleasant lunch. And you must save room for their cheesecake.

The fried macaroni and cheese are simply small scoops, breaded and fried as well.

The place is right by the mall so parking can be tough to find, especially if you want to park within easy walking distance.

However, I kinda expect that since i was paying quite a few bucks more like $12 for a burger. A slice of cheesecake was like $7.25. Therefore, if you are going to try this place, you should be willing to spend the money. The portion sizes vary upon the dishes but in generally they can be quite large and the average person won&amp;#39;t be able to eat more than a dish. 75% of the plate if you don&amp;#39;t want to feel to full and have room for dessert.

It is very much appreciated. What&amp;#39;s not appreciated is that no employees is even considerate enough to offer accommodation for big party (10 &amp;amp; up) seating even when there is enough outdoor seating? Honestly, tables with no customers seating on them are just plain waste. Out of your own employee&amp;#39;s convenience, you would rather have your customers wait 1~1.5 hours for the indoor seating. If this is what Cheesecake Factory call good business sense, I doubt anyone would make sense of it all. If all of your food chains are operating under the same system as the one in Arcadia, I would rather go to my preferred restaurant and/or eat at home. I had food and service much better than this that offer much better accommodation to the customer needs. I am not asking for &amp;#34;Customer is number one&amp;#34; just make some compromise and better accommodations when possible. The most disappointing restaurant experience I had.

This is probaly the best Cheescake Factory you can go to in this area, because the one in Glendale in Americana at Brand, and the one in Pasadena in Old Town is way more crowded than the one here. The one in Pasadena is always crowded and it is really small and tight, and not specious. The one in Glendale Americana, is also crowded, and when it first opened, it took 3 hours to get a table, with slow service. This one gets crowded during the peak lunch and dinner times, but there is a quick wait for a table if you come here in the afternoon at around 2 to 5. I came here at 3 on a Sunday, and we only had to wait 2 minutes so they can set up our table. The service is really good in this place, and really good food, and the menu for the Cheesecake Factory is big and extensive. I ordered the four cheese pasta which was really good, and which was really a big portion for a lunch portion. For dessert, I ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake which was also really good. Next time I go to The Cheesecake Factory, I will order the Factory Burger which looks good, which I wished I ordered, but I could&amp;#39;t because I ate alot of burgers that week.
