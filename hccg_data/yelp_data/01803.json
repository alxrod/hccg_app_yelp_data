The only reason I say it&amp;#39;s not great is because it&amp;#39;s still a chain after all, but they really do a pretty good job. We started our meal with mac and cheese balls and roasted brussel sprouts then I had the veggie burger. I have to say--Cheesecake Factory&amp;#39;s menu has become very vegetarian accommodating, which I appreciate.

I ordered the Chicken and Biscuits. I was extremely disappointed. I expected something along the lines of a southern meal with crispy chicken on mashed potatoes and buttery biscuits dressed in gravy. Instead it looked like a dissected chicken pot pie. The chicken which was breaded was soggy from the plate of gravy it was swimming in. There were peas and carrots everywhere.

When I am at this mall, my go-to is Legal Seafoods, but Cheesecake is a great alternative with huge menu. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;Why 4 out of 5 stars?? Because the floor around my table had French fries, prices of bread, lettuce etc. And I noticed the same around nearby tables. The waitress kept stepping on this food, it would crunch, \u00a0and it was strange they did not skimpily sweep up the food and trash.

Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, there&amp;#39;s always a wait at Natick too, but I&amp;#39;ve never had to wait THAT long. The only bright side is that there&amp;#39;s plenty of room for people waiting for a table to stand without being in the way of anyone. At Natick there&amp;#39;s a little less breathing room in that regard. <br&gt;<br&gt;Outside of that it was pretty much all downhill at the Burlington location, unfortunately. Our server was nice, but after such a long wait the food did not live up to my usual expectations. We had the egg roll sampler for an appetizer. I hadn&amp;#39;t tried it before, but I have had the avocado egg rolls before which this sampler also included. In the past I&amp;#39;ve found them to be a very tasty dish, but these were not perfectly crisp and fresh tasting like they usually are.<br&gt;<br&gt;When it came time to order entrees I chose the Louisiana Chicken. I always like to try a new dish when I visit Cheesecake Factory, but unfortunately I found this one a little boring and one-dimensional. The chicken was moist, but the pasta aspect of the dish was very underwhelming. A couple of others in my party also didn&amp;#39;t find their food to be up to par.<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s never fun to wait such an extraordinary amount of time for a table, but what makes it especially unfortunate is to leave feeling so underwhelmed.

I had ordered that dish at least three times before at other locations where they have generally been consistent and I knew exactly what to expect. My salad was adequate, but my entree came out cold and tasteless. The rice was in dry hardened clumps and was crunchy under my teeth. My entree was missing snow peas and shitake mushrooms which are two key ingredients based on the description on the menu. Also spices and seasonings were amiss. Most notably, there was no green curry in the dish which is key, the color was white. I sent my entree back and it came out a second time worse! It was bitter, tasteless, and cold AGAIN, seriously. <br&gt;<br&gt;I then asked to be moved to a table hoping it would be warmer and ordered a different entree. The entree took a forever to arrive, overall it was adequate but almost two hours had gone by. Considering this poor experience the Management made no apologies or gestures of any kind.<br&gt;<br&gt;One can only conclude that this location seems to have some major operational problems and is very poorly managed.

Being busy is understandable, things taking long are understandable, what isn&amp;#39;t though is bad attitude.

Forgot 2 of our appetizers (of-course he did because he wrote nothing down for a 14 top order) And when he realized we all worked in the service industry you just saw the attitude change but by then it was too late.

Tad pricey. Tons of options. (If it applies, great gluten-free selection!)<br&gt;<br&gt;Tonight was my first time ever at the Cheese Cake Factory, and I was truly impressed. I&amp;#39;ve been to the mall many times, and parking is fickle (sometimes you get lucky, most of the time you have to walk a bit). Today \u00a0I was lucky and got a place right next to the restaurant. I wasn&amp;#39;t really sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. The menu itself was expansive, and it took me a solid 10 minutes to skim through the whole thing. Deciding on a plate was its own beast, because so many of the options looked fantastic. The waitress was more than friendly, and continually assured us there was no rush. I decided on the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta - nothing but high praise, but we&amp;#39;ll get there. The bread they served was great, and I probably ate more than I should \u00a0have as a result. The pasta was delicious. A bit spicy, but its clearly labelled as such so I&amp;#39;m not going to doc points for that. The portions are massive, so make sure you&amp;#39;re hungry when you come in! I typically eat a lot, and I still had to take half of it home because I couldn&amp;#39;t finish it all. In the end I also got a slice of desert, and it completely lives up to the standard its name sets. If you&amp;#39;re looking for good food and a nice night out, you can&amp;#39;t go wrong here.<br&gt;<br&gt;I should also mention that I went with somebody who has a gluten-sensitivity, and she was blown away with the vast selection they have on their gluten free menu, in contrast to \u00a0the sparse pickings which typically plague someone with those limitations. She chose a pasta dish (a chancey move for gluten-free), and had no complaints about her meal either. <br&gt;<br&gt;The whole dinner for two came out to $50 dollars, which is far more expensive than I usually ever go. But they give you so much that we ended up taking about half of it home - so if you think about it as 2 meals, that \u00a0comes out to 25$ for great food, which is a more than reasonable price.

Though convenient to mall-goers, this can be a huge downfall to those who wish to just go out to dinner, because this particular location gets so crowded! They DO NOT take call ahead seating, which means that you just have to go there and wait... Additionally, by being attached to the mall, it attracts more young kids, crying babies in strollers, and other stragglers, if you will (I figured I&amp;#39;d mention, since some people care about this!)<br&gt;<br&gt;Their waitstaff is usually pretty good - obviously some are better than others, and the place is usually crazy busy, so you can&amp;#39;t always expect the best.

Here are some of my favorites:<br&gt;<br&gt;1) Crispy spicy beef: a yummy dish, medium spice level, and yes, it is crunchy, not soggy. I enjoy this entree, a lot.<br&gt;<br&gt;2) Renee&amp;#39;s special: though you have a couple choices for this one, I usually get the soup of the day, a Caesar salad - great dressing but VERY garlicky, so be careful if you&amp;#39;re on a first date/care about your breath post meal, and a chicken salad sandwich. For the price, this meal is a great value and great for your taste buds, and definitely does not leave you hungry. <br&gt;<br&gt;3) Another favorite of mine is (I forget the name) one of the pastas. It has farfalle (bow tie) pasta, sun dried tomatoes, chicken, peas, mushrooms... And it is amazing. When in doubt of what to order at this place, get a pasta!! Though this pasta is my go-to, I&amp;#39;ve had others and they&amp;#39;re always very flavorful and chock-full of ingredients.

WE sat down in the lounge (did not ask for it, but was fine with it) I \u00a0was joined by my mother and my grandmother. We usually come every 2 weeks to catch up and have lunch. Waitress came over introduced hereself, took our drink order, brought bread fine. no complaints.<br&gt;<br&gt;She came back asked if we wanted an appitizer (I was at a Cheesecake Factory in Florida about a month ago and they did a 4-6 happy hour, so I asked) Do you guys do happy hour here? and her response was &amp;#34;I dont know what time is it?&amp;#34; I looked at her, and said &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t know the exact time?&amp;#34; (WAS THAT THE QUESTION? my grandmother said 4:12, she said &amp;#34;then I guess we do, but if you were sitting in the dining room we would not give it to you, only in the lounge.&amp;#34; OK GREAT THANKS? .. I said &amp;#34;well since we are sitting in the lounge, do you think we could do it?&amp;#34; She said &amp;#34;Yup I&amp;#39;ll get you the menu, did you know about our little secret?&amp;#34; I said &amp;#34;what secret?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;she said happy hour?&amp;#34; I said &amp;#34;Well apparently not since I just asked you about it&amp;#34; she brought the menu told us she would give us a few minutes. <br&gt;<br&gt;She came back, I was thinking of ordering the Tuna tempura rolls. She asked if we had any questions, I said yes, &amp;#34;What is Nori?&amp;#34; She said &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t know....&amp;#34; I said &amp;#34;Oh, Okay&amp;#34; She said &amp;#34;Why is it on the Menu? I have \u00a0worked her for 9 years and have never heard of it.&amp;#34; My grandmother said - it is the seaweed the Sushi is rolled in. Well the waitress HAD to make it known again, she&amp;#39;s worked here 9 years and has never been asked and she knows EVERYTHING. OK great it&amp;#39;s fine you didn&amp;#39;t know it, it&amp;#39;s a big menu relax.<br&gt;<br&gt;We order, buffalo blasts (amazing) Tuna tempura, 2 small salads, and said everything would be fine to come out together. 5 minutes later the two salads came up, she put them down and said &amp;#34;well they were ready, is it okay if I put them down?&amp;#34; - were we supposed to say no?. She puts them down, I did not get a salad so I had nothing, does not really bother me. couple minutes later, The Tuna roll comes up. Presentation was beautiful. Again she mentions the Nori and shows me where it is in the \u00a0roll, yup thank I get it. I should have read the menu, i know Tempura means fried, but I was expecting the Sushi to be a little more on the raw side then fully cooked and did not like it (Not anyone&amp;#39;s fault, just was not for me!) She came over and i told her not to worry It just \u00a0wasn&amp;#39;t for me, she says &amp;#34;Oh yeah, you just must not know a lot about Sushi.&amp;#34; ........ NOPE, I do thanks, i just did not expect it to be cooked and do not like it. 15 minutes into the meal still no buffalo blasts, and we were not in a rush at all so we did not notice. The manager came over which was VERY nice apologized and said they would be right out and acknowledged they were taking a long time. 5 minutes later a food runner brings them out. we start eating them (mainly myself since I did not end up having a meal), waitress comes over tops 3 minutes later with the dessert menu and immedietly starts talking about cheesecake, and is staring at us. &amp;#34;Is anyone interested?&amp;#34; .. well probably not, since the last of our meal JUST came out. She says &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;ll leave the menu for you.&amp;#34; we continue eating, she comes back about 10 minutes later, which was fine, but asks us again- can we digest or?<br&gt;<br&gt;My grandmother gives her the food and says you can just wrap it. Wraps it brings it back, asks if we want Coffee, we order 2 cups. My mom was outside, we said she might want something shell be back in a few minutes. 5 minutes later she comes back with anothe waitress to let us know it&amp;#39;s shift change and she will be taking over from there.

I suspect that Cheesecake Fact. must have run into some problems w/ underage drinking, because the waiter very obviously, if not rudely, scrutinized our I.D.&amp;#39;s as if he was certain he was going to be able to make a bust. (the age group of our party of 3 ranged from mid-20&amp;#39;s to 40&amp;#39;s).

Also, we can&amp;#39;t help but wonder if there was some way the waiter could refrain from squeezing himself between tables when taking orders... this practice meant having his butt 2 inches from our faces while he took orders at the table next to us.

No, we dont have those.&amp;#34; Like she was a 3 year old. And then I suggested that mom look at the drink menu. I am sorry, there is just no reason to be that condescending to someone. Thankfully, after someone else had delivered our drinks, we had a new waitress come over. Apparently, mean girl had been cut. Our new server \u00a0was VERY nice. I knew that I needed a take-out at the beginning of my meal and was afraid to ask for the lunch portion from the original waitress, but gave it a shot with the new one. She said no, but at least I wasnt afraid to ask!! \u00a0Meal was excellent, mom LOVED her pear martini, and she left happy. We don&amp;#39;t get to spend time together often and we had a great time.
