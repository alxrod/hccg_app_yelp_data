Like not once a month a lot like 4+ times a month a lot. Topanga, Glendale, Sherman Oaks, Santa Monica are my mains. <br&gt;<br&gt;It was a busier than normal night for this location which is understandable but it was a pretty messy night all the way through. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now that you&amp;#39;re comfortable here&amp;#39;s why; there was half of Santa Monica waiting outside to be seated yet we were quoted 20-25 minutes, my boyfriend and figured it was due to a bunch of two tops about to leave. Well about 45 minutes later I decided to check on our table. I was told that they were waiting for tables to leave. Again understandable as people like to sit and chat after a meal. At around the 65 minute mark our buzzer buzzed. I handed it over and was told to wait in Cheesecake&amp;#39;s infamous secondary holding pattern until our name was called. <br&gt;<br&gt;We waited, and waited, and waited. We watched a lot of people get called, in fact everyone was called and I noticed the ticket holder was empty and new tickets were added. Without a doubt we knew that we were forgotten about. Cheesecake&amp;#39;s iron class system had failed for what you will find out not the first time. Again I asked what was going on and immediately the host realized the screw up and finally after an 1 hour and 20 minutes we were finally sat. We were both pissed to say the least. <br&gt;<br&gt;We knew exactly what we wanted and our server was extremely accommodating apologizing for his slow response (it was busy) so we understood. Side note our server was the best part of the experience. <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered food and drinks at the same time. I ordered a Makers Manhattan Up. For those of you who have no clue what that is it&amp;#39;s Makers Mark, sweet vermouth shaken in a tin (not stirred) poured into a martini glass (UP) and garnished with a cherry. Our Bartender was one of the ones who had no clue what this was. I was asked if I wanted it with ice or no ice. That doesn&amp;#39;t make sense I asked for it up. Then I got just makers mark shaken to death in a martini glass with only god knows what else in it. I received it 20 minutes after I ordered it. It tasted like a beginners whiskey watered down. No cherry no sweet vermouth. I reordered a Makers Neat. I was hoping the bartender that meant with no ice. It took a minute so I&amp;#39;m sure he googled it but I got it neat. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our food came out seconds after I finally got my first drink. I ordered the Tomato Basil Pasta my boyfriend the orange chicken. The pasta should have grilled chicken on it at least it used to. This one has about two cubes of something that resembled chicken. At this point I don&amp;#39;t care I&amp;#39;m not saying a word. My boyfriend looks at me with a look I dread. Disappointment. His orange chicken was okay but his white rice was definitely old it was dried out it was everything you don&amp;#39;t want white rice to be. Now before you say, &amp;#34;why would you order white rice and orange chicken at an American restaurant?!&amp;#34; I urge you to try it it&amp;#39;s delicious. Like who would have known?! <br&gt;<br&gt;The next day while at work we tend to talk food and as I rehashed my experience I decided to chip into corporate about the experience which I did.

We walked in and headed directly to the bakery. I made my order of:<br&gt;<br&gt;Celebration Cheesecake, $8.50 prior to tax- This cheesecake has layers of vanilla cake in between a layer of cheesecake, strawberry, chocolate and vanilla mousse. Also a cream cheese frosting, adorned with sprinkles (what birthday cake would be without it?). Yum and absolutely delicious! The creaminess and crumb of the vanilla cake go so well together and melt in your mouth. There was also a dollop of whipped cream on the side. This cheesecake was consumed over 3 days and each day was still very moist and perfect for dessert. My husband has never been a fan of anything birthday flavored (birthday flavored ice cream, cookies, etc) but did like this cheesecake. <br&gt;-------------------------<br&gt;(Total= $9.42 after tax)<br&gt;<br&gt;Service was friendly and fast.

It was a little spicy for me but I can&amp;#39;t stop eating them. The Cajun spice just makes me wanting more. It is definitely one of my new flavors for pasta. I didn&amp;#39;t finish my pasta, so I took them home and have left over for lunch the following day. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our service was very nice and attentive.

This makes me really sad for sure. <br&gt;<br&gt;We visited cheesecake on Sunday afternoon for brunch and to celebrate my father in laws birthday. It was early when we showed up so there was practically no wait. I did tell the host that we wanted to sit inside so she handed me a buzzer until an indoor server showed it.

It was very slow--not just in terms of how long we waited for our food, but our waitress checked on us ever 10, 15 minutes? We waited around to order our food, waited a while for refills on our drinks.<br&gt;<br&gt;And honestly, a couple servers were incredibly rude. Since our own server hadn&amp;#39;t walked by in around 15 minutes, my friend just asked random server walking by, politely might I add, if she could get a straw.

If you sit on the permitted by the glass wall, you get a great view of the 3rd Street Promenade. \u00a0Our group was too large for those tables, so we sat In a booth on the opposite wall. The patio is covered, which is great, so you still get the feeling of sitting outside, without sitting under the sun. They also have heaters above the table in case it gets cold. <br&gt;<br&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t realize how HUGE this restaurant was until I had to use the restroom.

Our waitress was great, very attentive. \u00a0When we ordered, two of us customized our orders. Nothing that difficult, just replacing cheese with avocado on a salad. <br&gt;<br&gt;The first time the salads came, we realized there was cheese and no avacado. We each took a few bites of the salmon that was on the salad before we realized this. \u00a0Our assigned waitress had gone on break, so we told our sub-waitress and she took them back. <br&gt;<br&gt;She returned about 10 minutes later with the salads. This time with no cheese or avacado. Also, they put the same half-eaten salmon back on the salads. So we asked for the manager, hoping that he could remedy the situation. \u00a0When he came to our table, he apologized for the mistake. <br&gt;<br&gt;He returned about 10 minutes later with our two salads, again with half-eaten salmon on them. We pointed out to him some pretty obvious things that he should have spotted as the restaurant manager. First, he was serving new salads with cold, half-eaten salmon on them. Second, how would he have known who gets which half-eaten salmon? \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;He apologized again, and took the salads back for a third time. At this point, the other two people at the table were almost done with their meals, so the manager said he would like to buy them each a cheesecake, so we are not eating alone by time the salads comes back out for the 4th time. He also said that he would not charge us for the salads. He returned about 5 minutes later with the salads, but no salmon. He said the new salmon was still cooking, but he didn&amp;#39;t want us to be waiting for our meals any longer. \u00a0About 5 minutes after that, he brought the salmon. <br&gt;<br&gt;When the check came, the two desserts were listed as free, but they were still charging us for the salads. \u00a0So we had to ask for the manage AGAIN to fix that error.

We ordered a calamari to start and their bread which are both delicious. Our waiter brought our drinks and calamari but forgot about our kids water and bread and took down our entrees.

We all work in the restaurant business and we know how busy it can get, but pulling food before asking if the guest are done is just rude. We asked to speak with management at this point, the manager promised us a new Stella plus another calamari on the house. We got the other calamari dropped of by yet another staff member but still no Stella. We asked them about our kids water which they quickly brought.

Lucky we flagged down another manager. We told them we were really upset at the whole experience and both the manager and waiter were immature. She said she was very sorry, but would try handle the situation. <br&gt;<br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We finally payed and were about to leave our table when the waiter brings us a new Stella, which we refuse and he followed back by rolling his eyes.

Mind you, It wouldn&amp;#39;t have been an issue for me that they didn&amp;#39;t allow pets. However, one girl (out of nowhere), interrupts her coworker and started making my friend and I feel so unwelcomed and uncomfortable, claiming we couldn&amp;#39;t eat there and it&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;California law that no restaurants have pets in patios&amp;#39; \u00a0(FYI that law changed in 2015). I have been to plenty of restaurants with pets in outdoor seating areas. <br&gt;<br&gt;Again, it was more the attitude we received by the staff than anything else. I&amp;#39;m conscious that some places aren&amp;#39;t pet-friendly, but there are ways in communicating that across, especially in places where you&amp;#39;re constantly dealing with people.<br&gt;<br&gt;So either this place needs newer/friendlier staff at the front desk, or the current ones need to be re-trained on their customer service (and &amp;#39;California law&amp;#39; for that matter).<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s such a shame.

First of all, I agree 100% with most of the negative reviews here because I also experienced it first hand tonight. We arrived at this location in Santa Monica \u00a0few minutes before 6pm, a little before the rush hour dinner and the hustle and bustle of the holidays. We got seated right away after a few minutes wait since it wasn&amp;#39;t that crazy busy yet. We sat outside the front patio area and had a server named Tim. At first, he seemed attentive and nice to us. But oh boy was I totally wrong. He did get to ask if we wanted drinks and asked what our orders were which went fine. He gave us water and some bread. We ordered an avocado egg roll which came out a lil after 15 mins. We ate them but didn&amp;#39;t finish because we waited for our main course meal which was a burger and I ordered the chicken madeira. So long story short, my mom and I have been waiting for our food over 20 minutes (which quite frankly not acceptable) because the couple sitting next to us who arrived later before us, had their food already, had eaten and was already being given To Go boxes already! So they were already eating dinner and finished...while my mom and I&amp;#39;s food still haven&amp;#39;t arrived in our table. Our server named &amp;#34;TIM&amp;#34; tall, skinny, dark haired white gay with glasses came over to the couples table sitting next to our table a few times helping them out,.. while he continously tries to ignore me and my mom. He DID NOT even asked how we were doing or how is the food like a good server does to its customers waiting for their food. So, I waited and past 20 mins over, I walked up to him and he tried to turn around and pretend that he couldn&amp;#39;t hear me. I literally had to chase him down near the front desk area, called him Sir Sir... I asked him &amp;#34;Where is our food?&amp;#34; and he said out loud, &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s really busy, can&amp;#39;t you tell?!&amp;#34; while he points to the many customers walking inside the restaurant. So, I said to him, &amp;#34; You don&amp;#39;t have to tell us that because we came here first than any of them and we have been waiting for more than 20 mins for our food, I would just like to cancel it because we have been waiting for so long. And then he just leaves me there without even apologizing to what happened. I found it very rude and unacceptable. So I asked for help from the front desk staff, and I asked one of them if I could speak to the restaurant manager. I told him that one of his waiters named &amp;#34;TIM&amp;#34; was VERY RUDE to us, did not even come back to check up on our food, did not apologize at all and ignored us. The restaurant manager named Ryan came over and talked to me and apologized to what had happened after I told him the story. His waiter definitely was rude and should not have said that oh we have so many customers so the food was delayed. But that wasn&amp;#39;t the case for the couple who sat beside us who got their food before we did even if we got there earlier than them. (Also the other people who came after me and my mom had their food as well already) The manager was nice enough to apologize and offered to pay our appetizer bill which was very kind and gave us free cheesecake to go home with. I was not very happy with the entire cheesecake factory experience here. I really like CF and have been going to many locations over the years. But I told the restaurant manager Ryan that this is my worst experience at a cheesecake factory. I know nobody is perfect and everyone has flaws. But I would and never could tolerate a bad attitude server/waiter to it&amp;#39;s consumers/customers especially if the customer is right. The manager in return said that server will be going home after his last tables at CF. He has done enough for the day. I hope you guys will avoid being served by that guy, I am not sure what his problems are and that is not an excuse to treat other customers who just want to have a nice dinner at CF to be treated poorly than others. I understand he doesn&amp;#39;t know when the food might be ready but at least try to check up on the tables that he waits to makes sure they are being taken care of and checking if their food was good or if we have gotten everything which we didn&amp;#39;t. Sadly, we left CF not eating dinner so we went somewhere else instead. I felt bad for my mom because she was really hungry and tired. I do not know if I am coming back to this CF location but maybe not unless they all pull their acts together and provide better service like other CF. Shame on you &amp;#34;TIM&amp;#34; (TALL, SKINNY, WHITE GAY WITH GLASSES AND SOME BEARD) You know who you are! If you are reading this!

The wings looked dry when you look at them, but they were alright. I was impressed with the baked mac and cheese balls, that came with a nice serving of marinara sauce. It was delicious.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the Cajun jambalaya just because I ordered it before. I forgot what my little brother ordered but we ordered miso salmon, herb crusted salmon, and then charbroiled steak. <br&gt;<br&gt;The miso salmon is the only one I do not recommend. Although the salmon was cooked really well, the amount of sugar in the dish was just so unappetizing to me. My dad who loves sugar even thought it was too sweet.

I ordered the 30th anniversary cheesecake and chicken and shrimp gumbo. Everyone liked their food except 1 friend ordered a pasta dish that was really bland. Don&amp;#39;t remember the name of it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Price- decent restaurant price. Cheesecakes are expensive but it&amp;#39;s like a 1 time order so whatever. I spent 34$ with tax and tip for those ^^^^^<br&gt;<br&gt;Customer service- our waitress Chelsea was really nice and attentive and kept refilling our bread and water, got the orders right and was fast. Best part of meal<br&gt;<br&gt;Venue- the place looks super nice and upscale. Bathrooms would look the same if they cleaned them often but there was stuff like gum in the sink, full trash can, etc. The utensils seemed old and somewhat not clean but idk if that&amp;#39;s the texture of the metal or calcified food...<br&gt;<br&gt;Crowd- it does get crowded and everyone looks well dressed unlike us who just had a roadtrip for 14 hours.

This is our go to order, we have ordered this many times before at other cheesecake locations. <br&gt;<br&gt;1. The waitress, Rochelle? Michelle? Rachel?, was so soft spoken we couldn&amp;#39;t even hear her name. When we ordered the pasta dish, she asked us to specifically point out the name because it seemed as if we were describing a dish, not ordering one. Aren&amp;#39;t the staff supposed to memorize the menu? <br&gt;<br&gt;2. We got the bread, which was warm and tasty like other locations. Then the food came out, after a seemingly longer than usual wait and the waitress took away the rest of our bread. WTF. <br&gt;<br&gt;3. The food was not that hot, if anything lukewarm. The salad was anemic. See side by side pic for the luau salad we had at the Newport Beach location in November vs the one we had in Santa Monica. Where is the salad part? Seriously it was all wonton skin. And no, it&amp;#39;s not the lunch version because there is no lunch version on the menu. <br&gt;<br&gt;4. The pasta. We cut into the chicken and it was raw. Not pink verging on cooked, but RAW. So we flagged the waitress and she had them fire a new one. In the meantime we finished the rest of our food, another waitress tried taking our plates, even though we were still waiting for the pasta. Finally what it seemed like the manager in red came over with a new pasta, asking us to see if the pasta is to our liking. It&amp;#39;s not that we were picky about the taste, we were bothered by the fact that it was raw and risks bearing disease. Anyway yes, the chicken was finally cooked. But now there was an issue with the taste of the pasta. The sauce was not cooked all the way through, just tasted like cream and raw garlic. At least with the first pasta, the sauce was an actual scampi. Midway through this pasta, another waiter brought out another chicken scampi dish, even though we already got one. <br&gt;<br&gt;5. We were so sick of this place that we didn&amp;#39;t even order a cheesecake. We thought we would at least get comped the pasta dish because we had to wait again for another one that was subpar to begin with. But nope. We were &amp;#34;comped&amp;#34; for the second pasta dish that was brought out by mistake. <br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, throughly disappointing. Terrible representation of the brand, and of the locale.

There&amp;#39;s absolutely no excuse for this! Shame on Cheesecake Factory! <br&gt;Let me explain; first off, they have elevators located on the side of the mall for easy access for customers and of course we waited for about 10 minutes and we called the restaurant to see if the elevators were working or not, and of course the hosts&amp;#39; response was &amp;#34;oh it just stopped working 5 minutes ago&amp;#34; ok yeah right. Then we had to ask her how to get into the restaurant because it wasn&amp;#39;t common sense on her end to explain to customers how to get in. <br&gt;2nd, we told the host our name and how many people were in our party. So we waited and waited and waited for them to call our name, and the restaurant was starting to fill up already, but name was never called and then all of a sudden they call out a name similar to ours with a different party amount, when I asked how long is it for our table she said oh we called you. Yeah whatever. They sat us down. And this is where the serious problems began. <br&gt;We ordered our appetizers, which were mediocre, then we ordered our entrees which were beyond horrible. <br&gt;My mother ordered a skinnylicious fresh vegetable salad with chicken and dressing on the side. When the salad came out, it looked disgusting, the salad was only lettuce edamame and nasty pale looking beets. I know what beets look like and I know the different colors they come in, but come on, if the beets don&amp;#39;t look presentable don&amp;#39;t put them on the plate. It&amp;#39;s common sense. Of course we told the waiter JUAN, this is not acceptable and we don&amp;#39;t want this , instead of being understanding and re-making the salad, he decided it was his place to educate me on what beets are and what they look like. No Juan, I&amp;#39;m sorry that&amp;#39;s not the right thing to do. So he left and went to bring a salad again, this time it was whatever. They just added the chicken and added the red beets. Then he gave attitude and I explained to him that that we aren&amp;#39;t trying to be difficult but we just want what we were expecting. Then he just walked away. After 10 minutes, one of the managers decided to walk to our table to ask what was wrong, I&amp;#39;m sorry but you are way to late to try to rectify the situation. We explained the situation but I guess it went over her head because she was clueless. We decided to take our check and just to leave. Then on the way out we decided let&amp;#39;s grab a whole cheesecake to go. We order a strawberry cheesecake but the person taking the order had a horrible attitude problem when I asked if the strawberries were sweet or sour. Obviously I&amp;#39;m asking because I want to know if I want strawberry or plain. Whatever I paid for the cake and waited. After sitting and watching the girl with her bare hands reaching into a container full of strawberries and putting it one by one on my cake, she stuck a strawberry in her mouth and continues to put my cake in the box! OMG I was in utter-shock! I couldn&amp;#39;t believe my eyes. I&amp;#39;m paying $60 for a cheesecake that someone is putting her hands on it after she stuck her fingers in her mouth. As soon as she said my cheesecake is ready, I politely asked her, did you just stick a strawberry in your mouth and touch my cake? Her response was, oh yeah but after! I was flabbergasted! I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it. I responded no you didn&amp;#39;t do it after you did it while you were handling my cake and her response was sorry. Then the gentleman at the counter said oh I&amp;#39;m so sorry I will make you another one and I said no, it&amp;#39;s ok thank you I just want a refund please. So the woman who took my order (the girl with attitude) said no problem and called the manager over to process the refund and when the manager came over she said that we want a refund for the cake because we had an issue and didn&amp;#39;t want it. And I intervened and said, no please explain to your manager why I didn&amp;#39;t want it, she didn&amp;#39;t want to explain to it because she was friends with the strawberry eater, while I was trying to explain to the manager, the girl started yelling at me while the manager was standing there saying &amp;#34;why are you asking me to explain if you&amp;#39;re going to explain doesn&amp;#39;t make sense, blah blah blah&amp;#34; and I said you don&amp;#39;t need to be rude to me, and of course the manager processed the refund and \u00a0said sorry and it was unacceptable but whatever.

It took her some time to notice I was standing right in front of her. <br&gt;After less than 10 minutes I gave her the shaker and she asked me to step aside, a server will ne with me shortly to take me to my table. Normally they print your name and place it on the counter for the servers to pick in order .<br&gt;After 15 minutes I asked her if these papers are un order because I&amp;#39;ve been waiting for 15 minutes and if she can check on my name. She said &amp;#34;they&amp;#39;re supposed to be in order so please wait&amp;#34; . I said ok. <br&gt;Another server came and grabbed 4 papers and only one paper left on the counter. I looked at the name and it said Judy not my name, so I assumed the server has my name. She called all 4 people except my name. <br&gt;I went up to the girl in the front desk and asked her if she printed my name because I dont see it and how come I&amp;#39;ve been waiting over 20 minutes after my shaker vibrated? <br&gt;She looked at me and asked my name and she said &amp;#34; oh I remember you&amp;#34; ... I said good for you,but they domt go based on what you remember, the servers go based on what you print and you have not printed my name yet after 20 minutes. She said sorry well give you a table. Wtf? Seriously? <br&gt;I asked her to write down her name which she denied to do so. Why are scared of giving me your name?<br&gt;I asked to speak to a manger, they someone who was not a manager and in fact was a sever. All he said was yeah the front desk lady is new, but we can give you a table now. \u00a0<br&gt;I was more frustrated with his answer, <br&gt;All she has to do is take name and print name. If she cannot do these two simple tasks then she is not trained enough and not ready to be on the floor. <br&gt;The &amp;#34;manager&amp;#39;s&amp;#34; reaction an response was even worse than the front desk girl&amp;#39;s response. <br&gt;I am disappointed to get a service from this place . <br&gt;It&amp;#39;s such a disappointment to have an experience like this and worse it&amp;#39;s how the workers try to handle the situation.

But seeing as every person on our table of 8 had something wrong with their order, the kitchen needs to get themselves together. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered a burger, pretty simple, I figured it was a safe bet. This burger didn&amp;#39;t come with lettuce, so I asked if they could put some on, no problem! (By the way, our server was very nice, my problem was with the kitchen.) So, the burger comes with the choice of a wheat bun, which I chose, but when I got it, 1) no lettuce, and 2) it was on a roll, like they give you in the basket when you sit down. I ignored the roll part but did ask for some lettuce. When I got it, I realized there was only tomatoes and cheese on one half of the &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; I wouldn&amp;#39;t call it a burger.

Not cool at all. Finally after 25 mins of waiting a server arrived to drop of 3 cutleries and 4 plates and that was it. THAT WAS IT. No menus were given. No &amp;#34;hello&amp;#34; from a server.

Throughout the night she payed no attention to us as we watched her continuously talk to other guests. She dropped off our food, and ran away before we could request anything. And when we did request something, she would throw attitude our way. Requesting straws, lemons, and ranch, seemed like the most annoying task to her, practically throwing it at us or on our table.

She had to go up front and get change for me, we waited for another 10 minutes, just for my change while we watched her once again go around talking to every other guest but \u00a0us.

This was my WORST experience at a Cheesecake Factory and possibly at any restaurant so far. Doubt I&amp;#39;ll ever walk into any Cheesecake Factory anywhere ever again due to this. Not worth it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Brought a service dog and was seated outdoors. Ordered our dinner for two and a beer. Ten minutes into the experience, a man from the restaurant came by to tell us the dog must be kept under the table at all times. We have been to numerous restaurants with our dog but had never been told that before. However, I took his word, and we further shortened the leash. Never once did our dog bark, run to other tables, or harass other customers. She did not fit entirely under the table due to her size and table leg in the way, but she remained quiet and near our laps. We were served our meals and discovered one dish was not the one we had ordered. So we notified the server and upon being told that it would take another ten minutes, we decided to cancel the dish. We weren&amp;#39;t rude about their incompetence; simply decided to cancel. I ate as quickly as possible because I was getting the vibe our dog was not as welcome as we initially thought, when close to the end of my meal, the restaurant manager (did not get a chance to catch her name) came to us to recite her interpretation of the law about service animals at restaurants. My mother had given our dog a piece of breadcrumb under the table (because that was where the dog remained), and if she saw this happening just one more time, she would report us to the Department of Health Services. Was she joking! I was so flabbergasted, I wanted to regurgitate my food. We immediately paid the bill and left leaving two thirds of my bottled beer untouched.<br&gt;<br&gt;If they want to offend customers, bully them with absurdly petty claims, treat them like criminals for giving their own dog a morsel of bread (not having offered any water for the dog as most other restaurants kindly do), and continue to receive majority negative reviews from Yelpers, please do continue with current poor management and awful customer service approach. \u00a0 And the manager had the worst attitude of all...seems to resonate in other reviews.

We have been to the Topanga and Thousand Oaks locations great service every time.<br&gt;<br&gt;However, our waiter (male, light skin, spoke Spanish, not positive on his ethnicity) gave us THE WORST SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!&amp;#39; You ask why? Hmmm well we immediately got seated out our table, not greeted, table was completely empty. No napkins or utensils. Okay, of course as a waitress I understood they were busy no problem. 25 minutes later STILL no idea who our waiter is at the time because we have yet to get a simple &amp;#34;hi so sorry, I&amp;#39;ll be right with you or even greeted us.&amp;#34; I waited 5 more minutes now sitting on 30 mins. Finally went up to the host and asked who our waiter may be to let him know we&amp;#39;re ready for him or her. She apologizes and says I&amp;#39;ll go find him so sorry for the wait. <br&gt;<br&gt;Again, no problem maybe there was a misunderstanding. Finally, our waiter comes up to us and apologizes and asks what we would like to order. <br&gt;<br&gt;First I said can we please 4 waters all around AND may I get fettuccini pasta no chicken, later my cousin, boyfriend, and her boyfriend ordered after me. We also ordered drinks. <br&gt;<br&gt;Another 20 mins and we ask the waiter when we will be getting our drinks? He said oh that&amp;#39;s right LET ME GO GET THEM. Honestly, our patience was starting to run out with this guy. <br&gt;<br&gt;Everyone got their pasta EXCEPT ME! I asked the our waiter how much more time until I receive mine.

The pervious busser who originally brought out the food for my boyfriend, cousin, etc finally came with my food. Great, awesome at this point I was relieved to finally get food in me.<br&gt;<br&gt;We noticed our waiter coming with another plate of fettuccini Alfredo and quickly turn around noticing I already had my food.

So I had to wait again for another 15 minutes while she brought another steak , a rib eye , medium well. They tried to tell me that the steak was rare because the red lights from the outside patio was making it look red. I used the light on my phone to show everyone it was mot pink at all . Either way a steak no matter how done or rare should not be tuff and flavorless like this steak was . Even the waiter agreed with me about the steak and couldn&amp;#39;t believe Katya spoke to me the way she did. Especially for being a manager. The way she spoke to was condescending and rude and basically made me feel like I was crazy.

Finally after about 2-minutes of back and forth, the manager walks by and affirms that it is INDEED not only the lunch portion but the SKINNY portion size.

Time passes i start eating off her plate, because i&amp;#39;m like where the heck is my food i&amp;#39;m starving. Finally our waiter comes back and was like &amp;#34;Sorry about the wait i sent your food bad because didn&amp;#39;t look good&amp;#34;. I&amp;#39;m thinking and you couldn&amp;#39;t have told me this ? Not even offered some water bread even a side salad? \u00a0So i say &amp;#34;Wow i thought you guys forgot about me&amp;#34;. He sits the plate down with two baby pieces of chicken in my pasta. Ive ordered it before dinner portion and lunch its never been little balls of chicken like this on the Louisiana Pasta. So now i&amp;#39;m confused. I waited 30 min for this ? I ask if i can get at least a lil more chicken on the side he says i have to be charged. I ask for the manger. She sucks just as much telling me sorry you waited so long nothing i can do you have to pay for extra chicken. Mind you i&amp;#39;m talking to her from the outside of my table she didn&amp;#39;t even have the courtesy to walk up to my table. She&amp;#39;s rude and rushing in a manner of hurry up so i can say no and do what i have to do. I&amp;#39;ve worked customer service before this isnt how you act or treat people. My sisters food is done and we no water no nothing don&amp;#39;t see the waiter again until we need the bill because our parking is about to be up so now i&amp;#39;m rushing my food that i&amp;#39;m unhappy with. Just so i don&amp;#39;t get a ticket. Just horrible service. There are so many places to eat down there don&amp;#39;t waste your time with that kind of service.

Ashley wrote me a little note on the bill that said P. S. sorry about the day care I thought that was kind of funny. I wrote Ashley a little note thanking her and how professional she was.

I should&amp;#39;ve went base on the reviews. Worst place ever to dine in, not just any Cheesecake Factory... but any restaurant to eat at. We waited for our table for like 10mins (which was ok) we got seated, we didn&amp;#39;t get our water till after 15-20mins later. Finally got our water, our server was no where to be found so we couldn&amp;#39;t even order. Server finally came, put in our order.... the kids meals came out with the appetizers (makes no sense at all) oh and the \u00a0complimentary bread came out with the appetizer and the kids meal. Weren&amp;#39;t we suppose to get that when we got seated along with the water that took so long for us to get. Kids finished their food, we finished our appetizers cause we were so hungry. Mind you we had a very long day and long drive there. The kids told me they were done and full, our food NEVER came out and our server was NO WHERE to be found. One of the host walked passed, I had to wave her down, she came and I told her to let our server know that we don&amp;#39;t want the food anymore because they took too long and for her to let him know to just box up the kids meal (they didn&amp;#39;t finish all their food) and get our tab. Because we had a long drive back. She said &amp;#34;oh ok?&amp;#34; She left, I&amp;#39;m sure she didn&amp;#39;t even let our server know. Cause she just walked passed us and said NOTHING to us, she treated us like we weren&amp;#39;t even there! Another server came out with the food, I told her we don&amp;#39;t want the food anymore. It took way too long for it to come out, the kids are done with their food and full now and we&amp;#39;re ready to leave. (It was 10:30pm at that time already, kids were tired and we were tired.) I told her we had let the host know to let you guys know, she gives me a look like uhhhhhh no she didn&amp;#39;t let us know. She told our server to come and he said you don&amp;#39;t want the food anymore, I told him I told the host to come let you know cause you were no where to be found. It&amp;#39;s late we just want to leave already. He said ohhhh ok (giving me attitude) the other server says &amp;#34;so do you want me to box these food?&amp;#34; I told her &amp;#34;no I don&amp;#39;t want it, so of course I don&amp;#39;t want it box.&amp;#34; We waited for our tab.... wow, and he took FORVER and like usual no where to be found. So we go to the bakery to get cheesecakes and asked the employee is it ok if we pay for our food there and he said your server was suppose to give you the tab and you pay with him. So my husband walks back to our table and waited for the tab while I was at the bakery.... then my husband comes back and said he never came and I sat there for a while. At this point, I&amp;#39;m annoyed! Like are you serious! Wow! Then the server saw us standing at the bakery giving us an ugly look as if we were not going to pay for our tab. Com&amp;#39;on we were at the bakery. He comes up and said oh I was looking for you guys! I told him we waited for you at the table, then came to the bakery and my husband went back to the table to wait for you...&amp;amp; you never came by, that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re here now getting cheesecakes. He says with an ugly attitude &amp;#34;well you know I had to get the manger&amp;#39;s approval to deduct the food you didn&amp;#39;t want. I can&amp;#39;t deduct it myself.&amp;#34; I told him &amp;#34;I didn&amp;#39;t want it cause it took forever for it to come out and you were NO WHERE to be found. Of course I&amp;#39;m going to pay for what my kids ate and the appetizers. That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m still here.&amp;#34; My husband paid for the tab. We got our cheesecakes and left. The only friendly employees were at the bakery. The hosts and a few servers were very rude.

However, the burger I had was disappointing. It was really greasy and had a bit of a burnt taste to it. It also lacked cheese for a burger that was supposed to be &amp;#34;really cheesy&amp;#34;. The waiter was also rude and did not acknowledge us when needed. After being disappointed with the food, I was finally excited for the cheesecake. I bought a cheesecake and apparently they charged me like 100$ for it. The employee noticed and freaked out and eventually they found out it was me when I was about to leave. They refunded the money back into my card right away and gave me back the money for the cheesecake , so it was very professional and friendly for them to do that.

I order a filet mignon and it was great.

My friend had gone to the &amp;#34;bathroom&amp;#34; to order the table surprise birthday cakes and this guy ruined it. We canceled them immediately. Not his fault, why couldn&amp;#39;t James have said &amp;#34;oh hey they have a surprise&amp;#34; instead he kept up the consistently crap service he provided in the first place and all was ruined. Not a single factor of the whole night was redeeming. Once we talked to the manager he was very apologetic and said &amp;#34;dont worry your cheesecakes will be free.&amp;#34; We were absolutely astounded WE DIDN&amp;#39;T GET THEM BECAUSE OF YOUR STAFF. So instead he payed for my steak which again, was nice, but I would have much rather paid for the food and have received nice service rather than get a free meal. And a side note the manager we talked to was a visiting manager and he was great, very apologetic and sharp. Once the actual manager of the place came over and heard the story and I had told him that Im going to give this place a bad review and not come back his response was simply &amp;#34;ok cool&amp;#34; and he walked away.

We, as a family, go to a Cheesecake factory location a few times a month and have always had a great experience. This was our first time at the Santa Monica Location. We were extremely disappointed and frustrated with our experience from start to finish. We were greeted by the hostess, who was rude and had no personality, she looked miserable and we felt quite unwelcome. When we were seated, we waited about 10 minutes until a server even acknowledged our table. While waiting we noticed that the silverware was dirty and a couple of our bread and butter plates on our table were dirty as well. When she finally greeted us, she threw the beverage napkins on the table and took our drink order. The drinks finally arrived after 10 minutes, one of the water glasses had dried spinach on it, after we pointed it out, she took it away and said she would bring another. I asked if she had any straws on her, she said no I don&amp;#39;t and walked away. I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if I was going to get a straw with that response. Five minutes later, she arrives again with a new glass of water, with no spinach and a few straws. She took our order and then the waiting began. It took almost 30 minutes for our food. Our food slowly staggered to the table, approximately 5-10 minutes in between each drop and there was 7 of us at the table. As each meal arrived we noticed that there were some issues. We noticed that my mom&amp;#39;s pizza was cold, my husbands turkey burger had onions all over it and no mushrooms and a different bun than what he usually has with it. My brothers skinny turkey burger arrived a little after my husbands with a different bun than my husbands and had mushrooms and he was missing his side of double vegetables. My brothers wife&amp;#39;s Kobe burger arrived over cooked. She ordered it medium, it was definitely well done and it had a sesame bun. She said she always orders that burger and it has never come with a sesame seed bun. The manager, his name is Keith, happened to be walking by, so I raised my hand nicely and gestured in our direction to come over. I wanted to tell him what has happened. First thing he says to me is, &amp;#34;its rude to point&amp;#34;, then laughs. Not a good first impression. We all did not find this funny as we were quite frustrated at this point. We told him what happened and he said, &amp;#34;well did you tell your server?&amp;#34; (why did that matter?) I said &amp;#34;no, I saw you walking by and decided to go to the source, as we have quite a few issues.&amp;#34; . He said &amp;#34;ok what do you need?&amp;#34; We began to go through the list of issues. He said &amp;#34;ok I will get a new Kobe burger in five minutes cooked medium, a side of double vegetables, a new bun for your husband&amp;#34; (turns out my husbands hamburger bun was gluten free. He had ordered the french fries gluten free so we can share, but he can have gluten, so the bun was not necessary)... &amp;#34;anything else?&amp;#34; We told him that we needed more ketchup and my mom&amp;#39;s pizza was cold. He asked if she wanted another, she said no, he said &amp;#34;okay we&amp;#39;ll take care of that pizza for you on the bill. Ill be back with everything in 5 minutes.&amp;#34; I noticed him walking around and not in the kitchen, where he should be, getting these issues fixed for our table. <br&gt;<br&gt;After 15 minutes we inquired about the re-fires on the fly from our server, she ended up coming out of the kitchen with the new bun for my husband as his turkey burger was freezing cold at this point, we didn&amp;#39;t bother saying anything. <br&gt;<br&gt;Over 30 minutes go by since the Kobe burger was taken back, we stopped the manager again to ask about the Kobe burger and veggies, he said &amp;#34;you still didn&amp;#39;t get it&amp;#34; and walks away. After going to the kitchen, a few minutes later, here comes my brothers wife&amp;#39;s Kobe burger, still overcooked and still on a sesame seed bun. My brother waited for his wife to eat, so he was now eating a freezing cold skinny turkey burger 30 minutes later, with still no vegetables in site. About 45 minutes later after our food first dropped comes out a tiny side of vegetables. What a disappointing dinner that was. Everyone ate at separate times and did not enjoy their food. We have been sitting for almost two hours at this point we wanted the check and to just leave. \u00a0The manager gets our table a free cheesecake, big deal. Took 30 minutes to arrive.

DAKOTA came over to pick up the check and we said we needed the change back. Took her 20mins to get us our change. Our original server had been back from break already and asked us if everything was ok and what we were waiting for and we let her know and she went to go look for DAKOTA. Another 10mins... DAKOTA came back from getting change and told my mom she only took 5mins.. at this point we had Joe back at the table since we wanted to leave already to enjoy the rest of the night/beach since we live 2hrs. away... and DAKOTA thought it was a good idea to sass back at MY MOM and started an argument with her!! NO WAY I WOULD LET SOMEONE TALK TO MY MOTHER IN ANY SUCH WAY!!!!!!!! DAKOTA had to be told to not do anything and was walked off by our original server. I was look for DAKOTA so I can speak to her and her manager. I went and followed her around and see maybe I could get her attention.

I went there with a friend yesterday and we sat outside and ordered a slice of cheesecake each. We waited for 25 minutes and it never came. Bearing in mind the cheesecakes are already made and all they need to do is put a slice on a plate and bring it to you, we were astonished at how long we were made to wait. We asked (who I assume was) the manager if it would take much longer, and she just kept saying &amp;#39;your server will be with you soon&amp;#39;. Since we had somewhere to be and almost half an hour had passed, we got up and were about to make our way inside (where the counter with the cheesecakes is) when the manager told us to sit back down and &amp;#39;your server will be right with you&amp;#39;. Our server was not right with us. So when the manager turned her back we had to sneak inside without her seeing. Once inside we told a different server about our issue. She looked like she was sucking on a lemon but did take us to the cheesecake counter. We asked for our cheesecakes, got them in a to go box and left. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you REALLY like the food, which is good.

I had a horrific experience at this one. My boyfriend and I were headed to a late night movie and decided to get something to eat. Unfortunately, our favorite restaurant in the world ( Wokcano ) was closed at this hour so we opted for the cheesecake factory which we definitely love as well. When we arrived the hostess sat us at very uncomfortable awkward seats when the entire restaurant was almost empty and we could have been seated elsewhere. Once our server finally showed up she reeked of cigarette smoke and gave us a very bland greeting. She took our drink orders my boyfriend asked for water and I got a Coke as I always do. The Coke tasted extremely sweet like a Diet Coke and was also flat. When it came time to order she wasn&amp;#39;t very informative on menu options. I ended up ordering orange chicken and my boyfriend ordered a make your own chicken sandwich with fries. When the waitress came back with our orders, \u00a0she did not come up to our table to deliver the food she delivered it from over a small wall we were sitting next to you which I thought was very odd. Was she just lazy? She didn&amp;#39;t bring the sauces we asked for on the side and our fries were completely cold and stale. Being in a rush for at the movies we just ate them anyways. Another server had to bring our check because our server was nowhere to be found. My boyfriend and I are amazing tippers when the service is worth it. However for this woman we simply left her a note in her server book saying &amp;#34; Maybe you should be a little nicer then you&amp;#39;ll get tipped. Your attitude was like the food. Cold and stale &amp;#34;. I really expected more from this visit.

After the third time it was clear I wasn&amp;#39;t getting clean silverware so I took my napkin and dipped it in the water to clean my silverware the best I could and rubbed the heck out of it to make sure it was clean, at least cleaner than what they gave me. Then I ordered the soup and salad which came with sourdough bread and butter on the side. I had to wait longer for my meal as they said they were making a new batch of soup. Great, fresh soup! But not so much. They brought my soup with a new spoon that also had leftover food on it which I had to clean AGAIN!!! Then my soup was lukewarm, what happened to fresh batch of soup? Lastly, I asked where my sourdough bread and butter was and the waitress said it never came with bread and butter, on<br&gt;Y the free bread that&amp;#39;s served before the meals. I checked the menu and it states, soup, salad, sourdough bread, and butter. Lastly, the soup sucked and my stomach hurt for a good two hours after. Not loving the Santa Monica location at all.

She asked for the hibachi steak medium rare and got the steak Diane well done. They came back with her correct plate but the steak was also well done. And 15 mins past my aunt has not received her extra pasta sauce. And one of the managers came and helped us correct the meals and it was ok.
