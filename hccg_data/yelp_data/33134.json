It is hands-down the best Cheesecake Factory I have been to. \u00a0They are definitely doing something behind the scenes to make this one stand out from the rest. \u00a0The parking for this place is actually convenient. \u00a0There is a parking garage right behind the restaurant that is not too expensive to park in. \u00a0If you can get a spot in there, take it because you only be a few steps away from the restaurant.<br&gt;<br&gt;On the surface, this Cheesecake Factory actually seems much smaller than most of its franchises even though it has the same d\u00e9cor. \u00a0This may sound like a detriment, but instead, this gives the restaurant a more-intimate feel. \u00a0The staff always starts you out with a sampler of their delightful bread, which is always freshly-baked. \u00a0Be sure to try their honey wheat bread. \u00a0It is superior to the traditional white bread. Their menu is absolutely massive. <br&gt;You would be hard-pressed to find something that does not appeal to you, so this is a perfect place to bring picky eaters. \u00a0They even have their &amp;#34;Skinnylicous&amp;#34; menu that has low-calorie and healthier takes on their traditional offerings. \u00a0They even have a &amp;#34;Skinnylicous&amp;#34; menu for drinks if you want your cocktail to be somewhat guiltfree. \u00a0I like to order from their &amp;#34;Skinnylicous&amp;#34; menus as their normal-sized food can be extremely filling.<br&gt;The mojito I ordered from the drink&amp;#39;s menu was well-crafted and refreshing. \u00a0It had the perfect combination of mint, basil, lime, and rum. \u00a0It also came in a tall glass so there was plenty to drink. \u00a0For an appetizer, we had their chicken taquitos. \u00a0This dish had a great combination of ingredients with a crunchy tortilla and was not too filling. \u00a0There are three taquitos per order so that keep that in mind if you decide to order this. <br&gt;I ordered the grilled steak medallions and they were perfectly cooked to order. \u00a0They paired perfectly with the fluffy mashed potatoes and savory mix of mushrooms, asparagus, and cherry tomatoes. \u00a0It&amp;#39;s a great dish if you want steak but without all of the guilt. \u00a0And yes, all of this is only 400 calories. \u00a0Another family member I was with ordered the Tuscan chicken and that was also delicious. \u00a0Perfectly grilled chicken with balsamic vinaigrette, tomatoes, artichokes, and capers served over farro. \u00a0This is another delectable dish that won&amp;#39;t leave you feeling bloated afterward. \u00a0Their &amp;#34;Skinnylicous&amp;#34; menu is definitely a hit.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you have been burned in the past by previous Cheesecake Factory experiences, I am whole-heartedly telling you to give this one in the Gables a shot. \u00a0It absolutely blows the other ones out of the water. \u00a0The food and service of this location make it so much better than the others. \u00a0And if you haven&amp;#39;t been to a Cheese Factory, then this one will spoil the rest for you.", "rating": 4, "date": "4/12/2020"}, {"text": "The Cheesecake Factory is a good go to place if you want lots of options.

One plate was basically pasta and a chicken parmesian (it took 4 servers to get together, which we saw them do, to then come back and ask how and what the parmesan was and how it was made? Really?!? The chef must be new. We were charged for the wrong plate that we sent back twice. The Turkey avacado sandwich was missing the avocado.
