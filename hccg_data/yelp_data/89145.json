We also ordered seared salmon with spinach. The salmon was so cold that when it came out the butter on the plate was already turning back into its sold form if you know what i mean. My other kids got the combo plate with shrimp scampi and steak Diane. Her steak was very good. Lukewarm but tasty. Needless to say we didnt take anything home. Still tipped on the 85$ bill.

On Sunday after a 30-minute drive we arrived and were promptly seated. Our waitress also was prompt in coming to the table for drinks and both boys ordered chocolate milk which she delivered without straws. With the Covid crisis they are a must-have. So we waited and waited for ANYONE to come by and I finally had to walk across the entire restaurant to the bar to get two straws and upon returning she was still nowhere to be seen. She finally reappeared to take our order and we were all excited to order chicken and waffles. She then stated they were out. So they were out of what we had driven 30 minutes for. We could have had bacon eggs and pancakes 5 minutes from the house !! Extremely disappointed the boys ordered just that with my Grandson ordering his eggs poached. They arrived in a puddle of water soft boiled not poached. We notified the waitress who now had more customers then she could handle and the second order came the exact same way. The kitchen needs to order some slotted spoons and teach the cook how to make eggs. I ordered the breakfast tacos that were supposed to be on a corn tortilla filled with chorizo eggs and cheese. When I attempted to pick one up it was total mush but I went ahead and took a bite and it was SO disgusting I literally spit it into the napkin. There was no soft taco no chorizo and the egg mixture was so disgusting I had an upset stomach for a couple of hours after leaving. While all of this was going on the table across from us also ordered chicken and waffles and of course were told the same thing we were.

Well one would think so because ordinarily it&amp;#39;s pretty hectic on every other day of the year. But this year, a server named Jessica C was an Angel in disguise.<br&gt;Knowing that they opened at 11 and cheesecake slices were 50% off today, we decided to meet up for an early lunch at 11:30. Surprisingly, we were seated immediately and warmly greeted by Jessica. \u00a0She brought out our water, Diet Coke, and raspberry lemonade promptly as well as their amazingly fresh bread.<br&gt;My husband decided to order the Skinnylicious burger with a side salad. My son ordered the cheese flatbread off of the kid&amp;#39;s menu. I always try something new and so I went with the lunch portion of Evelyn&amp;#39;s Favorite Pasta.<br&gt;Normally when we come to Cheesecake Factory, we wait so long that we fill up on drinks and bread. That&amp;#39;s not always the server&amp;#39;s fault, but oftentimes we get neglected and are sitting with watered down drinks or empty bread baskets for a while. Not today. Jessica was right there to top us off and refreshed our drinks.<br&gt;When our food came out, I was pleasantly surprised. My son&amp;#39;s flatbread pizza was ginormous! How is that possibly a kid&amp;#39;s meal? What a deal! The flatbread was soft, fresh, and very tasty. My son kind of filled up on his bread and lemonade though and didn&amp;#39;t eat much (also saving room for cheesecake of course).<br&gt;My husband was very happy with his skinny version of a burger. The side salad was basically greens with a vinaigrette dressing (which he saved for me to take home since he was making room for bread and cheesecake). It was cooked medium just as asked and presented without any of the extras, just as he likes. One of his pet peeve&amp;#39;s is asking for his burgers plain and they still decide to top everything on it. Not today!<br&gt;I was surprised with the size of the LUNCH portion of Evelyn&amp;#39;s Favorite Pasta. LUNCH!!! \u00a0I think it was $5-$6 cheaper than the full dinner sized. How much bigger could this have gotten? The penne pasta was perfectly cooked. It was drizzled with olive oil and the mixture of broccoli, roasted eggplant, roasted peppers, sun dried tomatoes, and artichoke hearts was a cacophony in my mouth. I was definitely content with this blend of flavors. I actually ate as much as I could (and took about 1/2 home).<br&gt;Last but not least, you have to save room for the cheesecake which was the main reason we came here today. At 50% off per slice, how can you resist? Technically you had to dine-in in order to get the deal. We had a full meal and so we hoped we could take it to go. My husband decided on chocolate mousse, my son chose Hershey Chocolate Bar, and I tried the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake.<br&gt;While we waited, Jessica happily refilled our drinks again and brought us take home containers and bags. When she brought out the cheesecakes, we noticed they were plated and not in containers. She said the cheesecake station were told not to put them directly in containers but that she would get us some. Of course we still ate a few bites before transferring them into their containers, but the fact that she didn&amp;#39;t just tell us tough luck, was a miracle in itself.<br&gt;This was the best experience I have ever had at Cheesecake Factory both in Las Vegas and in southern California.

I told him it was for me lol he said oh! Well let me go get it for you! He went and got it for me as well as making sure we had the drink for my daughters meal and a straw.

I immediately went into the cheesecake factory to see if we could either get a table for six or make a reservation for a table and was told there would be a 45 - 60 minute wait.

I just went to cook my leftovers to find out that I had saved half my meal for nothing. All that&amp;#39;s in my box is a sad piece of chicken medeira. They threw out my sauce, asparagus, mushrooms, and saddest of all, a huge mound of mashed potatoes. I purposefully left so much food behind so I could have a really good lunch later, and I trusted them to package it because it&amp;#39;s been done before. <br&gt;<br&gt;For the record, this is now the second time this has happened. Last time it was with a pasta entree, which was really sad. They left me like a single piece of chicken on top of dry noodles instead of packaging the whole thing.

First I couldn&amp;#39;t get a hold of anyone when I put down on my order I didn&amp;#39;t want to pick up for an hour but emails said would be ready in 20 minutes. I head out to the location because the phones would either say all lines busy, hang up or just ring. When showed up I was greeted in the parking lot by a disgruntled angry employee telling me if I didn&amp;#39;t get a text go away and find a place till I get a text. Okay that&amp;#39;s fine.. after over an hour of waiting 1 1/2 hours after my order was supposed to be ready and zero text message I send my friend to check on the order while I wait in my car in the wonderful desert heat. 10 minutes later I see him walking out with the bags and he exclaims that same pleasurable gentleman in the parking lot through down his clip board angry because he already told us if we didn&amp;#39;t get a text and how short staffed and all the issues they are having on the busiest day of the year. As if it&amp;#39;s the customers problem for the poorly staffed location. Few minutes later wait staff comes with his order he said and despite the anger he even gave him a generous tip. As we are driving my curiosity peaked on is that order even warm or do you think it&amp;#39;s been sitting there for over an hour... sure enough cold pretzel rolls and cold beans that feel like they have been there for a full day... once we get to my parents home which is supposed to be a nice Mother&amp;#39;s Day meal with my mother and father to find out our order isn&amp;#39;t even in the bag!

Nope off to the restaurant my friend went to go make sure our order isn&amp;#39;t just fixed again but hot this time! What a waste of time for an order that was supposed to be ready 2 hours ago. Now I work in customer service and I know there are ways a restaurant can handle days like this which include shutting down orders after a limit or only allowing cheesecake orders for pick up or making sure your system to text messaging is working because I still have not gotten my text my order is ready that was cold... so there isn&amp;#39;t just something wrong with the flow of your system but also your phone lines which isn&amp;#39;t being addressed which is easily fixed with a notice on the website.., trust me there are better ways to handle this.

Working for Aramark and other large venues in management this is failure on the manager and poor system put into place.

Of course, the avocado eggrolls are exquisite, but I seldom order them. Instead, I found a recipe that tastes exactly the same so make it at home.

Well two reasons, first I ordered fish and chips and honestly, the fish had no flavor or taste to it. The fries were cold and over salted, I kind felt like this offering is a after thought and there is an opportunity to relook at how this simple dish is prepped. With that said, the party I was with did state that their steak and chicken dishes came out well, therefore thinking next time I try one of those<br&gt;<br&gt;The second issue, the music was loud and I felt like it was hard to hold a conversation. I almost felt like they were trying to be a little trendy with their music choices.

Wanting a change from buns, I chose the wheat baguette. And ranch on the side for my salad. \u00a0As soon as my fork touched the burger, it fell apart, but it tasted okay. \u00a0But that wheat baguette was no wheat baguette. \u00a0It was more like pumpernickel, and it was SWEET! \u00a0So were the caramelized onions - adding sugar is a sloppy shortcut for the slow cooking that renders them naturally sweet. \u00a0My salad didn&amp;#39;t come with the ranch dressing I asked for. \u00a0Instead, it had the house dressing already on it. \u00a0Lots of it. \u00a0When the waiter brought a new salad and the ranch, that dressing turned out to be strangely sweet, too. \u00a0Sweet ranch??? Yuk, and yuk also for the salad, which was a sizable portion, but completely different from the one my husband got. \u00a0Not my kind of mix.<br&gt;<br&gt;Service was impersonally okay, but just average. \u00a0Three of us four liked what we ordered. \u00a0I&amp;#39;m the outlier, but I&amp;#39;m the one writing the review, so I get to give it three stars. \u00a0And I&amp;#39;m being generous.", "rating": 3, "date": "1/10/2017"}, {"text": "I like eating here.

And that&amp;#39;s a big plus because I&amp;#39;m generally not a fan of chain restaurants like C.F. or Olive Garden.<br&gt;<br&gt;Now on to the food.<br&gt;<br&gt;For an appetizer I had an order of buffalo chicken wings. They were yummy and had the right amount of zing to them. The best thing I had that night!<br&gt;<br&gt;For dinner I ordered the Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. It was cooked to order and even had pork belly in it. It wasn&amp;#39;t great but it wasn&amp;#39;t bad. Pretty average. And the only reason I can&amp;#39;t give my visit a perfect rating. <br&gt;<br&gt;I did have a bite of the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake and it was good.

This was our first time coming in and I don&amp;#39;t think I will be going back. We sat down and the waitress asked for our drink order. My husband first got a passion fruit margarita and then the classic lime margarita. For an appetizer, We ordered the variety egg rolls and they came out pretty fast. 1/2 of them were lukewarm, But we hadn&amp;#39;t eaten all day and just ate them without saying anything because we were starving. For our main course I had the chicken Madeira and the steak Diane and my husband has the shrimp scampi and steak diane. It took a while to come out, so the waitress gave us bread. But she had forgotten plates to accompany it... so we are it without plates. Once the food arrived the plates were EXTREMELY hot but the food was COLD!! My husband was too shy to say anything so he ate his, but I asked for it to be warm. I don&amp;#39;t expect to pay $24 for cold food!!! Anyways the manager came over and said he will remake it. I agreed, I waited 19 mins for the food to come out! By the time it came out my husband had already finished his meal. I asked for it to be put in a box since I didn&amp;#39;t feel like eating anymore. The waitress told us that the meal was going to be taken of the tab. She then brought us the dessert menu and we declined l, but she said she would not charge us for it so she recommended we try the tuxedo cheesecake. When we finally received the bill we were charged for my meal.... I was furious becuase she had preciously told us that it would be taken off. I asked why it wasn&amp;#39;t and the waitress replied saying she took the meal that was cold that the manager &amp;#34;offered&amp;#34; to remake..... WTF! So basically I would have been paying for 2 meals for myself if I didn&amp;#39;t have it sent back!! Overall we ended up paying a $100 tab with no remorse for the bad service or my screwed up meal.

We arrived to the restaurant 10 min early for our reservation. The host asked us to wait because our reservation was for 5:00. No problem. Four parties walked in after we had checked in and were all seated fairly quickly, almost instantly. So I rechecked in with the host asking how it was going for our table, and her response was they were waiting for the 5:00 server to come on so we could have a quieter table. No problem. I reminded the host that it was our anniversary and I wanted to try and do something special for my husband. She said no problem she would let the server know. We were sat not to long after and honestly had a great dinning experience and great service from our server, until it came to the end of the experience. I tried to remind the server, without giving it away, that I wanted to do something special for our anniversary, something as simple as a candle or two so I could tell my husband happy anniversary and that i loved him. No acknowledgement, no awareness to what I was trying to inform him, deserts hit the table normally, no candles, nothing special. We enjoyed our deserts completely before the server came back to ask how they were. At this point I was a little heart broken and had told my husband my original plan. After knowing everything, he himself was heart broken for me and felt he should inform the server about it. The server said he was sorry he didn&amp;#39;t know that I was our anniversary and then lit his lighter and said happy anniversary to us... Still not feeling they understand how much they let us down we decided to just let the manager know about the poor experience. After explaining everything to her she simply responded I&amp;#39;m sorry that happened and went on with her night, no real sorrow, no sort of recovery, no accountability. I&amp;#39;m not one to drop names as I feel dinning experiences come from the whole restaurant team from front to back of house. We were not looking for any compensation when it came to the bill, but to explain to multiple people about how the experience went, and to have to pay $130 tab for the two of us just kind of added to the disappointment. We are not foodies, we don&amp;#39;t not personally work in the food and beverage industry, but growing up with my brother and his passion for hospitality and making experiences for his guests when they come into his restaurant, this was a definite let down.", "rating": 1, "date": "6/6/2020"}, {"text": "Im definitely not a regular of the cheesecake factory, but this was an occasion with my girlfriend&amp;#39;s parents.

I knew it was going to be busy so placed my order online at 2:00pm for a 6:00pm pick up. Just a couple of entrees, kids meal,a couple of cheesecakes...nothing big. I live in Centennial Hills so I leave my house around 5:30pm to be on time, get there a little before 6 and I can see a line of people outside all the way around the building. Cars parked everywhere as well so I had to park at the parking structure East of the restaurant. I waited for the text from them as indicated on the pick up instructions but after waiting for 25 minutes I decided to go inside and inquire about my order. The girl taking reservations at the entrance tells me that I have to get in line to pick up my order. I took me another 35 minutes to finally reach the desk so I&amp;#39;ve been there almost an hour by now. Once I talk to the girl about my order she tells me that it&amp;#39;s going to take another hour to an hour and forty five minutes!! I was dumbfounded.... i ask to speak to a manager and after waiting for him for another 10 minutes he tells me that unfortunately it&amp;#39;s a very busy day. My choices are to just go home and they will credit my paid order or wait for an hour and 45 minutes for my order....I decided to just leave empty handed and frustrated like never before. Cheesecake Factory is not a new restaurant, I&amp;#39;m sure they are very good at dealing with big crowds since every time that we go there it&amp;#39;s busy how they don&amp;#39;t prepare for a day like Father&amp;#39;s Day??

What do I have to do next time ( it won&amp;#39;t be one) but for someone else placing and order online they have to specify a time 2 hours before the time they want the order just so it will be actually on time???

I was going to write my review Sunday, but I&amp;#39;m glad I waited because my Sunday experience was HORRIBLE, like 2 star bad, but my Monday experience was great, 5 star great. I averaged them out to give this review. <br&gt;<br&gt;Sunday: We came in for cheesecake, but since we had to dine in, we git some breakfast that I didn&amp;#39;t know they served on Sundays. The service we got the whole time was absolutely horrible. There weren&amp;#39;t many people there when we got there so we didn&amp;#39;t wait long to be seated. She brought us water and that was about it. The rest of the time we had to keep flagging her down to get anything from her. It took 15 minutes to get our coffee and actually order our food. Then she never came back. It took 30 minutes before we could flag her down to actually get us some bread that we had to actually ask for when everybody else was just given their bread. She was definitely not off to a good start. She kept going back and forth to the table next to us, giving them stuff and checking on them, but never came to us, unless we actually flagged her down and yelled for her. To me, that&amp;#39;s not acceptable customer service. It almost made us not ever want to come back here. Only reason we came back, was to get more half price cheesecake the next day. We made sure we weren&amp;#39;t going to get her the next day again, by sitting at the bar on Monday.<br&gt;<br&gt;Monday: We strictly went to the bar in hopes we&amp;#39;d get better service. We certainly did. We initially came for happy hour drinks and cheesecake, but ended up ordering some appetizers for dinner since the happy hour menu is pretty cheap. Thank god we had good service at the bar or we probably never would&amp;#39;ve went back. Our bartender was always checking on us to see if we needed anything, constantly refilling our drinks, conversating with us, after everybody was taken care of. We even got our bread this time right away and didn&amp;#39;t even have to ask for it. And to top it off, we got great service during happy hour when the whole place was packed and every seat was taken. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now, onto the actual food. <br&gt;<br&gt;For breakfast, we ordered the fried chicken and waffles Benedict and the chilaquiles carnitas. I really enjoyed the Benedict. It definitely had a unique sweet flavor that I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting, but it was delicious. The carnitas was a bed of tortilla chips with a green chilli pork mix over them. I wasn&amp;#39;t a fan of them, but my boyfriend enjoyed them. We also ordered their new cheesecakes: the celebration cheesecake and the coffee and cream cheesecake. The celebration one wasn&amp;#39;t exactly what I was expecting. It was SUPER sweet. My complaint is that there was very little cheesecake in it. It was almost all cake and a cream mousse stuff. I was hoping it was going to be majority cheesecake, but it wasn&amp;#39;t. I can&amp;#39;t say that is order it again. The coffee and cream one, was very chocolatey with coffee. If you like those two flavors, you&amp;#39;ll like that cheesecake. <br&gt;<br&gt;For happy hour, I started off with the JW pink lemonade that was pretty good. We ordered 3 appetizers to share: Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, factory nachos and the buffalo blasts. They were all great. You won&amp;#39;t be disappointed with any of them. They are pretty big servings so be careful how much you order. We couldn&amp;#39;t even finish the nachos. Then we ordered cheesecake to go because there was no way we had room to eat there. We got the chocolate hazelnut crunch, Chris&amp;#39; outrageous, mango key lime and Reeses peanut butter. I didn&amp;#39;t like Chris&amp;#39; because I don&amp;#39;t like coconut or walnuts, but if you like them and almond joy, you&amp;#39;ll love that one. My boyfriend loved it so much, he ate the whole thing in one sitting. I really enjoyed the other three tho. The hazelnut crunch is really good.

Bread was delivered. And this is when it started to get interesting...<br&gt;One of the party members was a known picky person. She frequents this establishment and has had no problems ordering her usual request in the past. <br&gt;Fast forward to post ordering meal delivery. Corn tamales gluten free ON POINT! A salad entree arrived and a party member politely stated that the dressing order on the side is not present. Now this is where I need to tell you how Cheesecake operates: Your your food is not delivered by the waiter it is delivered by someone else. And a majority of your service is delivered by some random person. The only time you see your waiter is when they decide to come back and check on you. It took 15 minutes to get that dressing nectar. The picky person&amp;#39;s entr\u00e9e was completely wrong. She was not happy. After a weird conversation with the waiter - he actually stated out of the 30 page menu that no chicken breast existed in the building...a manager became involved and in 5 minutes the glorious food arrived! Meanwhile a party member still had not received his SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS. This member had the easiest order and it came out 10 minutes after everyone including the totally messed up redone entree did. Fast forward to dessert ordering, it was asked to be to go it came back on a plate about 10 minutes later it arrived in a to go container. Whatever that was OK because it took us about 10 minutes to get the bill situated. I forgot to tell you that in the middle of dinner two of the party members asked for extra sauce and we got the bill we noticed that we were charged four dollars for a little gravy boat of sauce (note in the past I have never been charged for extra sauce so this came as a real shock.) My sister was charge for an extra side of potatoes that never was ordered (she asked for double mashed instead of the vegetable.) All of these bogus charges were removed and we all learned a valuable lesson: never to order extra sauce at Cheesecake Factory ever again. Because of the way everything ended out in the end (bill rightfully modified and foods delivered as ordered - btw the side of mashed and two sauces dropped the bill FIFTEEN DOLLARS!)

I hate to be mean, but his name might as well have been Tony tough nuts. He tried to be nice, but the vibe from him just was not good.

So I asked the waiter to send it back since, ya know, we couldn&amp;#39;t even dip chips in it because it was like half an avocado at a time.<br&gt;<br&gt;He brings it back, and says...yeah just so you know that&amp;#39;s how we do the guacamole now, so if you want it more mashed up you have to specify. REALLY?! It&amp;#39;s a DIP, not pieces of apple you&amp;#39;re eating.

The experience though, knocked it a star, otherwise it would have been one of my favorite restaurants we checked out this weekend.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered a Flying Gorilla beverage to start and it was pretty much my favorite part of a very, very late lunch. Still, we all were able to order from the lunch menu. I had the Avocado Rolls to start, followed by the Chinese Chicken Salad. Everything tasted great, though I&amp;#39;m not a huge fan of the thin, white crispy noodles. I should have asked for them to go easy on that, because there was literally a mountain of it (hence no photo). <br&gt;<br&gt;Appetizers came out fast, but everything else was weird, honestly. My sister ordered a Pi\u00f1a Colada to start and then a Pepperoni Pizza. I don&amp;#39;t think she was a huge fan of the drink, but she said the pizza was pretty much what she hoped for. Even at lunch, the portion was rather large. Leftovers, yo! Only problem is she got her food way before our friend and I. She was almost done by the time I got our food.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our friend ordered Calamari to start, which I would recommend to everyone, because their Calamari is always so good! Lightly fried, crispy bits of octopus makes for a great appetizer and big enough to share! She ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and seemed to enjoy that as well.<br&gt;<br&gt;So what happened to our bread? You know that thing they usually bring out at the very beginning at every Cheesecake Factory? Apparently they were running behind on a lot of our order, which was surprising for a weekend. Tina our server was as helpful as she could be, despite not being able to get everything out at the same time. The bread didn&amp;#39;t even come out until we were ready for the check, so that was kind of annoying. <br&gt;<br&gt;I would only recommend they staff the kitchen properly on a Saturday, no exceptions.

However I could tell, almost immediately, that this visit was going to be not a good as previous experiences. Our server, Shawn M, came over to us right away and said &amp;#34;is everything okay over here?&amp;#34; This was a very odd way to greet a couple who had literally just been seated. We replied yes. He asked if we were ready to order. We&amp;#39;d been there less than 5 min so we said no. We placed our drink orders and asked for a few more min to review the menu. This was a mistake! Almost 15 min went by before our waiter came back to take our order. We had even closed our menus hoping he&amp;#39;d see we were ready to order. He was attending to other tables right near us. He finally took our order. Another several min went by before someone brought bread to our table. As we ate the yummy bread and waited for our food, we caught wind of an unsatisfied couple right next to us. They seemed to be making quite a fit about some cucumbers and arugula being left off. The manager was at their table trying to smooth it over. Perhaps this is why the waiter in my area seemed off... Our food arrived finally. I ordered the mushroom burger with a salad. My bf ordered the chicken avocado club. Our food was very good. I got a side of ranch to dip my burger in and it was tasty. As we ate, the snobby couple next to us continued to be a pain. The manager ended up re-making their food to-go for them to make up for the mistake. The couple continued to sit at their table even after checking out. Awkward!! I was about half way through my food when they finally got up to leave. As they left I hear the girl say &amp;#34;this is hysterical that they re-made our food!&amp;#34; The Summerlin snobs left and mood quickly went from tense to peaceful. <br&gt;<br&gt;In conclusion, my experience today was just alright.

The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant that specializes in burgers, sandwiches, pasta, and pizza. <br&gt;<br&gt; \u00a0Yesterday after hanging out in Sabalatte in the Boca Park Fashion Village, my brother and I were up for dinner.

I have been to the Caesar&amp;#39;s Palace location quite a few times. <br&gt;<br&gt; \u00a0When my brother and I stepped inside the dimly lit and elegant restaurant, it was understandably busy. The friendly hostess took our name and kindly let us know that there would be a five minute wait. The Cheesecake Factory has yet to implement the text messaging system that some restaurants have incorporated. The wait was less than five minutes. <br&gt;<br&gt; \u00a0Tina was our waitress. She was friendly, never rushed us, and constantly checked up on us. I am giving a shout out for Tina on account of the fact that my brother left his sunglasses at the table. As we approached the Valley parking area (on the way to the upper deck), Tina comes running after us with his sunglasses. With that said, the service here rounded up Cheesecake Factory to four stars. <br&gt;<br&gt; \u00a0The food is also delicious. Everytime that I have dined in a Cheesecake Factory, the large portions had filled me up leaving me with no room for cheesecake. In my opinion, Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant for either dinner or coffee and dessert. We just had coffee at Sabalatte, so tonight I ordered their chicken parmesan sandwich which included fries and a Coke. The chicken parmesan sandwich is unique. I don&amp;#39;t know of many restaurants that make it. Plus, it is delicious. Between the time of ordering and Tina delivering the sandwich, she delivered the customary dinner rolls. In past visits to the Caesar&amp;#39;s Palace Cheesecake Factory, the pasta sauce was included. \u00a0Here, there is a separate bowl of the sauce where you pour it on to your liking. I enjoyed every bite of the chicken parmesan sandwich. It is something that I do not enjoy very often. I also enjoyed the small bowl of French fries that accompanied the sandwich. And the Coke did not have a hint of flatness. It was just as sparkling as Tina&amp;#39;s attitude. <br&gt;<br&gt; \u00a0Cheesecake Factory was $20 well spent. The dining area is not Tiffany elegance but an elegance similar to dining in a Caesar&amp;#39;s Palace, Venetian Hotel, or upscale resort Cafe. It is a dining environment that isolates the outside world and is simply relaxing. The food was delicious and filling. Service was outstanding.

The other server brings us bread and our server walks up and is semi snippy and said the wheat bread was in the oven that&amp;#39;s why we didn&amp;#39;t get bread (still she could have offered us white or at least communicated with us.) then another 30 minutes go by at this point I&amp;#39;m like where is our food this is ridiculous it was 10:30 pm so not dinner rush hour.

I eat the two thinly sliced grilled chicken breasts with the dish but the pasta is disgusting so i wait and i wait to let her know i don&amp;#39;t like it and she never comes back. I flag the hostess down (at this point it&amp;#39;s been 15 min since the food was dropped) she gets the server and i could tell the server was just annoyed and ready to go hone and she said no problem I&amp;#39;ll twke the pasta off but I&amp;#39;ll just charge you for the chicken.

I&amp;#39;m not at all worried about the $5 chicken charge but i really feel since the waitress wouldn&amp;#39;t check with the kitchen on if chicken picatta could be made the way i always get it, and the long wait on the food, she was just being catty with me to charge for the chicken.

Before my sandwich finally came one of the managers came to sort of apologize and quickly left our table before we could even express our unhappiness. The final straw was when our waiter was clearly trying to be rid of us, moving too quickly to hand us boxes and our boxed up cheesecake, he knocked over my half drunk (overly expensive) drink all over my phone and all down the front of me.

I&amp;#39;m not so sure that this is reflected in today&amp;#39;s restaurants, started by their son, David. <br&gt;<br&gt;My family decided that we would venture into the not-so-upscale Fashion Village at Boca Park. Because Cheesecake Factory boasts an expansive menu, even for the kiddos, I guess I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind holding our spot in line for our large party. A promised 45-minute wait, although expected at peak dining hours on a Saturday night, was cut down to about 25 minutes: an unexpected, but welcome, plus! The host stand seemed filled with unnerving hostesses as well as the hustle and bustle of seating all the walk-up guests. They probably needed a break and a reminder that every new customer deserves a positive experience. <br&gt;<br&gt;Upon seating, I was immediately greeted my by waitress. Her smile appeared genuine and her customer service rhetoric was unwavering excellent. I was impressed. A secondary server/busser provided bread and waters for all the guests without question. It was fantastic. Our waitress was very accommodating, making suggestions, attentively listening to our requests/restrictions, and tending to the needs of the young children at the table. Upon everyone&amp;#39;s food delivery, a manager approached my table to discuss the reason as to why my salmon salad wasn&amp;#39;t delivered yet. He stated a vague, yet wordsmithed response in which he basically stalled for an additional 7 minutes. The &amp;#34;fish just wasn&amp;#39;t right&amp;#34; probably meant that it wasn&amp;#39;t cooked yet, it fell on the floor, they forgot, or any combination of two. A specific, yet honest answer would have been more appreciated. Isn&amp;#39;t honesty the best policy?<br&gt;<br&gt;Although the selected dishes varied, I will comment on what I tasted during my experience. My salmon salad for $17.95 was delicious. An herb-crusted salmon topped field greens, cut tomatoes, endive, and asparagus paired nicely with my glass of iced green tea (suggest simple syrup from the bar to accompany the drink). The salmon looked at least 8oz and did not overpower the dish. I recommend the ranch in lieu of the vinaigrette. The children&amp;#39;s pepperoni pizza can be a little spicy for children, so be wary of your picky eaters. The tostada salad is a mouth-watering heaping mound of greens atop chicken and a tostada. The lettuce wasn&amp;#39;t dried/spun prior to plating and, therefore, left an unnecessary pool of water on the plate and tostada (which transformed into a soft taco shell). The meatloaf is average: nothing special and nothing exciting. Save yourself and select an alternative dish. For dessert, the limoncello cream torte was to die for. Layers of vanilla cake christened with lemon marscopone allows for a sweet dish worthy in lieu of any dessert wine. <br&gt;<br&gt;As we received the check, our desserts were double charged, a strike two for our experience.

My wife and I walked in at about 3:30PM and it was almost entirely empty. My wife is currently walking with a cane as she is recovering from knee replacement surgery.

Does she know that 95% of the tables are wide open? I am not exaggerating, it was 95% EMPTY!!!! <br&gt;<br&gt;OK, let it go... she was stupid.

Hers was what you&amp;#39;d expect - typical Cheesecake Factory OK meal. Mine on the other hand was UNDERWHELMING. Our server informed me that the salmon on this salad usually comes cold, unless I would like it heated. I opted for warmed. Big mistake. Their idea of warmed seemed to be microwaved to the point of shriveled and hard around the edges. Also their idea of salad seemed to be dump some greens out of a bag o&amp;#39; salad and dress it up with a couple of sticks of asparagus. Come on guys... make me a fresh piece of fish and use some higher quality greens. Like I said, UNDERWHELMING!<br&gt;<br&gt;I really expect that in a restaurant, they should be able to prepare/cook a piece of fish better than I can at home. I also expect freshly cooked, not what had to be cooked yesterday (or last week) before it went bad and then refrigerated to hold it for leftovers for the salad. <br&gt;<br&gt;Lots of staff standing around with a dirty floor.

They sat us with 8 because the rest of our group would take some time.<br&gt;<br&gt;Starting with the food. I am an impulse kind of guy, i like to try new things but don&amp;#39;t like deciding. This time i actually saw a picture of the dish i got on a screen above the bakery counter. I got the steak Diane. med rare super tender and flavorfull. with potatoes. I also tried some of the caesar salad. Both amazing and up to par for cheesecake factory.<br&gt;<br&gt;We got sat and we were starving. our waiter came over explained the specials as they usually do. We were very thirsty and asked for water. He claimed he was not taking drinks right now he will just explain the specials and come back in a few minutes. Something im not really used to hearing as we all just wanted water. I am myself a server so i tried to be understanding. When he did come back a few minutes later. we gave our drink orders mostly water. My girl said we ready to order too when you are. He explained &amp;#34;ok well im just gonna take the drinks now until the rest of your group gets here give me a minute&amp;#34;. The tone was very unfriendly to me and my entire group. It was obvious he knew we were a gratuity table and since we were young did not care to go above and beyond to get the little extra that cheesecake servers usually give. At this point i started to pay attention to him. Noticing which tables he was responsible for, how many were seated etc etc. this just justified the fact that yes we were a gratuity table of kids to him and so he did not care as much as he did his other tables. When he came back i decided to speak up as the rest of my group were kinda annoyed. I explained clear we are ready to order when you are, the rest of our group will not be here for awhile. This is after about 15 minutes of us being seated already. an estimate of about 35 minutes until we finally started receiving our food. Not ideal but nothing we could do at this point. My water specifically was refilled only twice, i drink a lot of water, and less than half way through my meal i was done. and didn&amp;#39;t get a refill until i was done with my meal. Then once more AFTER i received my split check at which point i no longer needed a refill.<br&gt;<br&gt;Order taken food arriving and the rest of our group showed up. <br&gt;<br&gt;this part annoyed me the most, he explained to our friends that just arrived &amp;#34;yeah they didn&amp;#39;t wait for you guys so let me know when your ready to order&amp;#34;. Little does this server know we explained that to them already and they are the ones who told us to order because they would not be there for awhile.<br&gt;<br&gt;This is something i am not used to at cheesecake factory. This particular server definitely did not start us off right. i am sure that the rest of my group might not understand why. But as a management myself i know when a server notices a young gratuity table and does not care to meet minimum standards of service. We were his only large table and from what i could see he was not so overwhelmed that he could not care to give us the service he was giving others. Where as his smaller tables got lots of time and attention.<br&gt;<br&gt;Night ended and he put us all on one check. Someone asked to have it split and he did so. Thing was he knew pretty much exactly what everyone had. The time it took for him to bring us the split checks, and cash us out was definitely inattentive. We were actually trying to meet our next destination at a certain time but ended up not going because we were waiting for him to cash out our checks. We got the first check at 22:13 and my check personally was not checked out till about 22:33 per my receipts. <br&gt;<br&gt;with this series of bad events and lack of care for a young gratuity table. that is why 3 stars.<br&gt;<br&gt;My only advice is if you have a large group try your best not to have this server. <br&gt;<br&gt;automatic gratuity is necessary but should never be an excuse for poor service at a restaurant known for service.", "rating": 3, "date": "12/20/2013"}, {"text": "I have been going to Cheesecake Factory over 20 years.

THEY GET 1 STAR FOR THE FOOD BUT EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT IS HORRIBLE!<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered a to-go order on the phone and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. \u00a0I got there about 17 minutes after my call. I stood for a good 5-10 minutes just waiting for help. When someone finally appeared she pulled up my order and gave me the total and then got told by someone else behind the counter that the person standing next to me was waiting first. That person was standing there when I got there and was only waiting on a cheesecake to go. Not a complicated order (didn&amp;#39;t require the kitchen) and she had to have been waiting at least 15-20 minutes. \u00a0My order took about 30 minutes. I ordered a burrito with extra sour cream and guacamole so when they showed me a container with visible sour cream I figured that was the extra. When I got home, however, it turns out the there was NO sour cream or guacamole on or around the burrito. The &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; I ordered was less than what would have come with the burrito let alone constitute anything near the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; I paid for. There was no guacamole at all with or for the burrito.

We then waited another 15 minutes for them to find the order (the order taker put it under Taylor even though I spelled my name out to her over the phone, she obviously wasn&amp;#39;t listening). Another 15 minutes passed and we finally received the food. If you are counting that&amp;#39;s 45 minutes waiting for a pick up order. <br&gt;We got home and ate the food.... The fries were soggy, the sandwiches were luke warm, and the marshmallow on top of our lemon cheesecake was melted and unrecognizable (but still tasty).<br&gt;Fast forward 2 hours and we were both sick.

I asked my husband to go in with our son to purchase our cheesecakes while our daughter and I stay in the car.

Last year I was able to purchase three cheesecakes by myself at another location. Anyway, it would&amp;#39;ve been fine if he could only purchase the two at half-off, but this cashier should&amp;#39;ve informed him if they had a limit so he didn&amp;#39;t have to go through the trouble of returning it.

Everyone at my table loved him, and said the same thing... that he is on of the best waiters we have ever had&amp;#34; at a restaurant.&amp;#34;<br&gt;The atmosphere is a great combination of everything that a person could want. As mentioned earlier there is a dine-in and a take-out option but they also have many other options. Sitting out on the patio to enjoy the weather or stay inside the dining room to avoid the weather. Join the bar for a more social environment. The best time for the bar is during happy hour for that social mood. You could also, snug yourself away in booth for a more intimate setting. The vibe of the restaurant is very upbeat, friendly, fun, personable and beautiful. The walls have beautiful large European murals and pillars. The space is open but a cozy feel as well.

Every time I come here, I try a dish that I haven&amp;#39;t had here before and always leave disappointed. <br&gt;<br&gt;When you order the lettuce wraps, on the plate comes ice burg lettuce cups, three different sauces, chicken, and veggies and you build your own wrap. Its good and enjoyable to make yourself. Plus not everyone likes the same sauces and whatnot so they have the choice of what they want. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Miso Glazed Salmon is served on a bed of mashed potatoes and a side of cooked asparagus. The perfect combination if you ask me, and if you are there at lunch time you have the option of ordering the 1/2 order since the dinner size is really big. But my recent order was the taco salad. it wasn&amp;#39;t anything special but shredded lettuce, strips of seasoned tortilla chips tomatoes and avocado tossed in a mayo chipotle dressing and served as three heaping HILLS on your plate. Really? I paid $13 for this dish, something i could&amp;#39;ve made at home...was disappointed to say the least.<br&gt;<br&gt;I have tried a variety of their cheesecakes and the newest to my top list is the Pineapple upside down cake. The pineapple and crust is at the bottom and the cream cheese itself has a pineapple&amp;#39;s flavor to it. Not so sweet, but just a perfect blend so you can enjoy it rather than having to take a sip of water between every bite. <br&gt;<br&gt;The service from a recent visit i have gone was lacking.

Fifteen minutes later we get the salad which looked more like a bowl of lettuce with nothing else mixed in it. It was clearly missing some of the ingredients. The manager came around and offered to replace the salad with a new one made correctly. After three tries, we were served a simple salad that should&amp;#39;ve been on the table an hour before. I did my best to be understanding towards the server until she dropped the check off with three salads on there and she had only taken off one of them from the total. Basically they expected me to pay for THEIR mistake.

She stated in a very short manner &amp;#34;well I thought you might have been with another party that had already checked in&amp;#34;. A simple greeting and may I help you could have cleared any uncertainty.. My wife and I were then seated immediately by another hostess who apologized. I asked to speak with a manager and someone who appeared to be a waiter approached the table and stated that he was the manager and would address the poor customer service my wife and I experienced on what was our wedding anniversary lunch. He didn&amp;#39;t seem to take my complaint very seriously and to top it off, once we received our food, it was extremely salty.

Barely held the drinks and the plates. We had two of the small appetizers, the corn fritters and the fried artichoke hearts. They were both very good. This is why I have to at least apply the second star. Now I can only speak for my lunch but it was inedible. I ordered the lunch Chicken Picatta. I knew as soon as it was set in front of me something was not right. The chicken was a shade of white like I have never seen before. I took a bite anyway, It was retched, I spit it right out. I thought maybe it was me, tried a second bite. Again same terrible spoiled taste. The only person I saw who worked there was the bus boy, I told him the chicken was bad. He promptly took my plate. He came back after a few minutes to tell me the manager would be over and they were cooking another one for me. I told him no thanks, just the thought of chicken was making me sick. The manager came over to ask me what was wrong. I explained, she was behaving as though she did not believe me. Starts telling me that they get fresh food every other day. I am not saying they don&amp;#39;t, but the damn chicken was bad. She states maybe it is the capers, NO i have had capers a million times, I did not even put a caper in my mouth. I told her that I was being very discreet regarding this and did not cause a scene. She asked if I would prefer something else, I ordered a plain burger. When the burger arrived it was fine. <br&gt;What bothers me the most is that they were acting like I was making this up. Second my son and I ate in shifts. I do not see my son enough to want to have our lunch together ruined and eaten in shifts. <br&gt;When I got the check, my son asked if they removed the chicken charge, they did, he asked if they charged for the burger, they did.

Even though there were hardly any customers, it took a long time before our food came out, leaving me no choice but to eat a lot of the bread. By the time my soup came out, I was already full, but I managed to finish most of the soup. The soup itself was very hearty and chunky with lots of lentils, reminiscent of porridge. The flavors were good, but the bacon flavor that the server emphasized was not vey noticeable. Overall, I enjoyed my visit.

Although I&amp;#39;m not totally ruling out a return visit when my cheesecake craving returns.", "rating": 2, "date": "7/2/2010"}, {"text": "love love love cheesecake factory! came in on a sunday at peak dinner hour. we were able to get seats right away in the bar area. i like that this place has a little bit of everything. a little asian, a little mexican, etc. the menu is huge which makes it hard to choose something to eat sometimes. i had the garlic noodles with chicken which was very tasty. my friends ordered the chicken enchiladas and the combo of steak diane and salmon. all of it very good. didn&amp;#39;t order any cheesecake this time which is a first! service was great. can&amp;#39;t wait to come back!", "rating": 4, "date": "11/14/2010"}, {"text": "It&amp;#39;s pretty good food here but I&amp;#39;m kind of iffy about the service.

Southwest eggrolls, Chicken Coquettes w/fontina cheese, Avacado Eggrolls, Stuffed Mushrooms in marsala wine sauce. Over 30 items under $6 for HH. That&amp;#39;s impressive! Everything was well cooked and delicious. Large, well made drink specials like Long Island Iced Tea $5, pizza for the kids and desserts to make you smile or moan. \u00a0A special small plate menu in addition to the HH menu. Many, many choices on the regular menu around $13 which is a bargain in LV. \u00a0I met several people who eat there 2-3x a week. This chain is a winner and tops any other I have ever been to. Going to miss it since there is none within 3 hrs of me. \u00a0The Rampart location does get crowded but there is plenty of parking although. you may have to walk a block across the parking lot if it is dinner hour.

We got there and it was pretty busy but was sat within 4 minutes. Where we got sat was unfortunately cramped with other restaurant patrons seated so close to us we almost thought they were eating with us. It took approximately 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us who let us know that he isn&amp;#39;t really our server but will get us some water while we wait. The Menu That takes you about 25 minutes to read cause it&amp;#39;s more like a novel than an menu had bought our &amp;#34;real server&amp;#34; time I guess to realize she&amp;#39;s our waitress. We only got 1 order of bread I guess our first and last cause my friend mentioned to our &amp;#34;not our waiter&amp;#34; and our &amp;#34;real waiter&amp;#34; for more bread while we wait for our meal that was already taking a while of which was ignored. The experience was not a good one, They would of gotten 1 star but I gave 2 cause honestly we felt sorry for our waitress cause she appeared overwhelmed.
