We use to come by all the time to get free food but then I think we grew out of it. But coming back here after being away for so long...all I can say is...where have I been!<br&gt;<br&gt;I recently came out with a friend who got a gift card for Christmas. The story is that I was complaining that you can&amp;#39;t get good Shepherd&amp;#39;s pie in Georgia. I have no idea why I have an affinity for British foods but I do. The craving is especially evident after I watch some kind of show or movie with British accents. Well my friend somehow among her other random knowledge of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; that is either completely useless and or deemed nearly completely useless said <br&gt;<br&gt;&amp;#34;hey the cheesecake factory has awesome shepherd&amp;#39;s pie!&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;Me: How...what....how do you even know this? I mean it&amp;#39;s not like Shepherd&amp;#39;s pie is brought up in everyday conversations like... hey you know where I can get a good cup of coffee...or a slice of good pizza or donuts....<br&gt;<br&gt;My friend Aimee: dunno, too much Doctor Who episodes I suppose...<br&gt;<br&gt;Well she was right. The Cheesecake Factory does known how to rock a Shepherd&amp;#39;s pie. The sauce was flavorful and not overly salty. The portions was generous. Our waiter was super sweet and attentive.

The cheesecakes are delicious without a doubt, but it&amp;#39;s not worth the ridiculous prices, extremely long waits (to be seated and for your food), and terrible customer service. <br&gt;<br&gt;Long story short, I ordered my fianc\u00e9 a cheesecake for his birthday last year, and honestly if I wanted the cake to look like a 5 year old made it, I would have asked my niece. I ordered the cake around 9am the morning of his birthday to be ready by 4pm. I got there a little after 4pm thinking that I would give them an extra 10-15 minutes to get my order ready because it&amp;#39;s always extremely busy there. Didn&amp;#39;t get my order until over 40 minutes after my arrival so it was actually about an hour after the pickup time that I requested, and yet a couple of the workers had the audacity to be extra stank and cause a scene when I was quite politely inquiring about the wait time. It&amp;#39;s just cheesecake guys. I&amp;#39;m sure it gets very busy there, but you don&amp;#39;t have to make transferring a slice of cheesecake onto a plate with a squirt of whipped cream that difficult and stressful--it will be okay. <br&gt;<br&gt;Even though it was evident that something was wrong from an employee yelling and being dramatic over plating cheesecake, there wasn&amp;#39;t a manager or supervisor in sight to try to deescalate the situation. Two employees tried to remedy the horrific experience I had, and they were very sweet and accommodating, which is pretty standard for decent customer service nowadays, but it&amp;#39;s unfortunate that some can&amp;#39;t even manage that.<br&gt;<br&gt;Aside from the cheesecake, there&amp;#39;s really nothing else worth coming here for. The food is subpar and extremely overpriced. Not worth it at all unless you like overly greasy and flavorless food with high prices. I probably would never eat here again, and it may take a while for me to actually want to order a cheesecake from them again, but next time I&amp;#39;ll be sure not to order it for a special occasion and arrive an hour later than my pickup time.", "rating": 1, "date": "3/3/2019"}, {"text": "I ordered the truffle honey chicken and Madeira/ stk dian for curb side pick up.

These should either be revised or removed from the menu. The cheese and meat inside was kind of congealed. I expected them to be hot and more or less oozing from the cheese factor. It was neither.

I requested the salmon and steak cooked medium. After a long wait, the dish arrived and I began eating to find that both items were overcooked. They should not even take a temperature request on the thin slices of meat they refer to as steak. I asked my waiter for the manager and cut into the center of both proteins ready to show that they were a far cry from medium. The manager agrees that the food is overcooked and offers to make me another one. I decline since neither my appetizer nor the entree were acceptable thus far and at this point, I wasn&amp;#39;t going to hold out for the third time being the charm. I told him I would be happy to pay for the kid&amp;#39;s meal and the two drinks I had ordered if he would give us a slice of cheesecake for the inconvenience.

We were told there was a 10 minute wait. We stood there for maybe about 10-15 mins before our names were called to be seated. Not bad at all!!! So when they called us to seat us, we both noticed them walking us to the far left-side of the building near the kitchen area. At that time it was a lot of opened tables for both large and small parties to be seated. We looked around at the patrons awaiting a meal and they looked frustrated. We noticed why after waiting 15-20 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us. The waiters were just casually strolling around as if no one needed serving while sitting at the tables. The waiter that chose to help us took our beverage order and apologized for no one assisting us. Next, the waiter brings our beverages back...my husband tried the new &amp;#34;Cucumber Lemonade&amp;#34; (that&amp;#39;s so refreshing and delicious) and I wanted my favorite Arnold Palmer! He brings the drinks out with which appeared to be sugar around the rims of our glass! But once we tasted our beverages and noticed that they were salty sweet, we then noticed that the sugar appeared to be salt! We flagged the waiter down and told him and once again he apologizes and takes the drinks away. We wait another 5 minutes and our waiter comes back out, but with no drinks! He then goes over to acknowledge a new family of 6 patrons and begins to introduce himself and take their drink order! At this point, my husband and I began to get frustrated! I think the waiter could feel our eyes piercing his soul so he turns around and say &amp;#34;your drinks are coming right out&amp;#34;! At this point, we thought drones were going to deliver them because he sure in the hell didn&amp;#39;t have them and we are at a 20-30 minute wait now with no drinks nor food! He hurriedly walks away \u200d and comes back with our drinks. We taste them on the spot to make sure they are indeed right this time and they were! He asks us if we need more time to look at the food options and I think my husband and I were synchronized when saying &amp;#34;NO&amp;#34;! We put our orders in and sat patiently while eating bread and drinking our drinks. Another 15-20 minutes goes by and another waiter or maybe management staff brings our food out to us.

I ordered a mojito and a water and lemons, my mother ordered a water with SEVERAL LEMONS, my sister ordered the same. She came back with our water and about 5 thinly sliced lemons. <br&gt;Then asked us if we wanted to order any appetizers which I did, I ordered the buffalo blast and she brought us some bread. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ok here is where it gets a little rough.....she brought the appetizer and asked if we were ready to order. I ordered the Greek salad and my sister was trying to figure out what she had the last time she was there, asked the waitress some questions about the entree and after about 3 mins she placed her order. My mother still had not decided what she wanted so we told the waitress to just put our order in and give my mother a little time.

What?! <br&gt;We thought she had done that already when she took our order the first time. <br&gt;<br&gt;And way after that we sat there for a good 40 mins watching other people that arrived after U.S. Get their food.

Parking is easiest from the lot to the right in front of Dillards department store and walking across, unless you want to pay the valet but you&amp;#39;ll still end up walking a bit so I&amp;#39;d advise you to forego that inconvenience.<br&gt;<br&gt;I have a feeling that most of you have had the experience of the Cheesecake Factory - the first built (and now closed and replaced by a different location) in Buckhead at one time was the highest-grossing restaurant in the US. I believe this location was the second or third built in Atlanta and it&amp;#39;s a really fantastic location. The interior has a fantasy array of Byzantine columns, wonderful fantasy-like wall sconces and very feminine fresco-like murals on a warm tan stucco adorning the ceilings - quite nice and it will make you feel a bit like you&amp;#39;ve entered a Disney theme park restaurant, however much like said-park the experience hardly meets the promise. I&amp;#39;ve worked in this area of Dunwoody for 15 or so years off-and-on so I&amp;#39;ve had many occasion to eat at this Cheesecake Factory. It&amp;#39;s not a bad place to meet for special occasions as they can accommodate large parties - for my most recent visit I met with many coworkers for a bittersweet occasion - a member of our team was leaving for another work opportunity.<br&gt;<br&gt;When you are seated you&amp;#39;ll be presented with a booklet of many, many items and now I&amp;#39;ll voice my biggest gripe. The menu is much too large - I mean it&amp;#39;s so big that there&amp;#39;s advertising on some of the pages - is it a menu, or a catalog? I really don&amp;#39;t see how any restaurant can offer so many dishes and hope to do all of them well. The last thing I want to see is a binder full of pages - where do you start? What&amp;#39;s good? What&amp;#39;s not? Too many choices. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food here, and I&amp;#39;ve tried dozens of items, is passable - no real standouts from the many appetizer or entree sections. I honestly can&amp;#39;t recommend any one item as something that&amp;#39;s your missing or something you can&amp;#39;t get elsewhere and I think this is where the restaurant&amp;#39;s identity takes a hit. You&amp;#39;re sitting in this fantastic setting yet with one exception, the food is pretty humdrum. We&amp;#39;ll get to that exception shortly. I do like the basket of bread that they bring out - something about that wheat bread I really like. But then again, don&amp;#39;t come here for the bread. When I think about the food here it reminds me a bit of TGI Fridays. Not that they are all that similar, but the food is very formulaic which is both a good and bad thing. It&amp;#39;s good in that there&amp;#39;s usually some semblance of food balance - starch to fat to acid ratios are good. It&amp;#39;s bad in that the combinations are a bit tired - not much magic here. For mall food it&amp;#39;s good and certainly better than the food court - of course you&amp;#39;re paying more for it as well. Back to the Fridays comparison - I think the food here is better than Friday&amp;#39;s as it&amp;#39;s less snacky and more of a meal. Satisfying but not awesome.<br&gt;<br&gt;The exception of course are the desserts. I am not a big fan of cheesecake - it tends to sit very heavy with me, but I&amp;#39;ll concede that the cheesecakes here are exceptional. I also like the Sunday and the ice cream in general. And maybe that&amp;#39;s the point - I mean it is called &amp;#34;The Cheesecake Factory&amp;#34; so perhaps everything leading up to the dessert is just the build up to the big finish? But if so, why the phone-book menu?<br&gt;<br&gt;My final point is about the service. I find it very hit-or-miss. I&amp;#39;ve received both exceptional service and horrible service and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to matter what size the party is - sometimes the service is amazing on a group of 20 and terrible on just two. No rhyme or reason for it. I&amp;#39;ve had so many orders get screwed up here and it&amp;#39;s really unclear if it was the server or the kitchen. I&amp;#39;ve had tables where everything showed up together except one lost plate and it took 20 minutes for it to appear with everyone either finished or sitting in front of cold plates, to wrong items showing up, to meals with food restrictive (bacon) items showing up with extra (bacon), etc. When service is good the server is usually very attentive and fixes any mistakes quickly. When service is bad you can&amp;#39;t find the server and the attitude is really crappy. Like I said, hit-or-miss.<br&gt;<br&gt;So what&amp;#39;s my final overall opinion? I think The Cheesecake Factory is exceptional for their desserts. The appetizer and entrees are mediocre but palatable and certainly better than mall food. The service hit-or-miss. Would I eat there again? Sure as it&amp;#39;s close and useful for certain situations. Do I find myself wanting to go here?

The fried mac and cheese appetizers are really good, they give you 4 and that will fill 2 people up before any entree itself. I&amp;#39;ve had entrees like chicken parm, philly cheesesteak, and some of the pasta dishes. I think overall the quantity is huge, they give you a lot for what you&amp;#39;re paying. The food doesn&amp;#39;t always taste quite cohesive, for example the philly cheesesteak has too many large peppers that kind overpower the meat.<br&gt;<br&gt;Service and quality can be variable sometimes, when it gets busy it can be hard to get a waiter or waitress, and i agree with some of the comments that you might notice a few dirty plates/utensils because they didn&amp;#39;t clean it well (perhaps they just put it in a washer without scrubbing completely). I do think they try to make the place clean but with so much foot traffic the quality of cleanliness seems to drop sometimes.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall it kinda does feel like a factory, there&amp;#39;s large quantities of decent food at ok prices, but a lot of small details can get overlooked with service and cleanliness.", "rating": 3, "date": "4/5/2015"}, {"text": "Seated and waited over 20min... still have not seen our server.

When we ordered dessert at the end , the waiter said &amp;#34; to go I assume&amp;#34;. <br&gt;We have been to different locations many times before &amp;amp; we like it , but this visit to the Dunwoody location ( in perimeter mall) I give it a 0/10. <br&gt;<br&gt;Merry Christmas.", "rating": 1, "date": "12/30/2017"}, {"text": "The customer service at this location is the worst I have seen in any restaurant. We came in from out of town with a group of 8 and arrived to the location at 8:40pm. We talked to the hostess and she said between 30-45 minutes, our group had no problem with waiting, since it was a Saturday night that didn&amp;#39;t seem too bad. After an hour we noticed that it had really started to clear out and we still did not have a table nor had anyone come up to us to say it was going to be longer. I went back up to the host stand and talked to a man who said he would check on our table. When he walked away he went to an EMPTY table and picked up a tray with glasses on it. He came back to the stand and didn&amp;#39;t say anything to us to let us know it was ready just started cleaning menus and talking to coworkers. After another 10 minutes of wondering, I went back up to him and ask what he found out he then said &amp;#34;oh right&amp;#34; got our menus and led us to a table. <br&gt;<br&gt;After waiting for over an hour the last thing you want is to get to the table and have an ongoing bad experience--unfortunately that&amp;#39;s exactly what happened. Our server came over and seemed nice and ordered our drinks right away and said bread and butter would be out soon. Most of us ordered just water with the exception of 3 bar drinks, at this time one of the guys in our party ordered a slice of cheesecake. Took at least 30 minutes for the waters to come out and then another 10 for the bar drinks. Still no sign of the cheesecake OR the bread &amp;amp; butter after those 40 minutes. When we questioned the server about the cheesecake she made an excuse on how busy they were with Togo orders even though it had quieted done immensely in the restaurant since it was now almost 11pm. We asked to speak to a manager and she asked why so we explained. She then came back 2 minutes later with the cheesecake and said she had just gone and did it herself, which we appreciated though why couldn&amp;#39;t that have been done earlier? Bread came out next with a promise that food should be out shortly, and it did. One of the guys in our party had ordered plain angel hair pasta with just butter and told the server nothing else just butter after the server looked at him like he was crazy for ordering that. When his plate came out the server held it slanted to show him and asked if it was okay the way it was and the kitchen had made it with just a little bit of tomato on it... the entire pasta was covered in raw tomatoes. How does plain translate to tomatoes? No clue. Regardless, she took it back...at this point my fianc\u00e9 finally has had enough to get up and find the manager since the server never sent him over to us after we asked. He found the manager and explained what happened from the time we came up until that point. My fianc\u00e9 came and sat down as the rest of the food was coming out. The food was set in front of us quite hastily, I assume the server saw someone in our party speak to the manager. The manager came over to our whole table to ask how things were and to see if we had any appetizers, we answered with a no but one of the guys in our group got cheesecake. The manager nodded his head blowing it off and said he talked to the hosts upfront and had a &amp;#34;teaching moment&amp;#34; with them. He left and we all ate. The food was good like it usually is so no complaints there and the only reason why this gets a one star rating. The next time we saw our server she was at the table next to us chatting with them which is great but she never even tried to have a conversation with our group.<br&gt;<br&gt;When it was time for the check to come it was a long process to even receive the check and even longer one to get the cards back. Our whole party was frustrated and tired of being at the restaurant. It was now almost midnight and someone else in our group went to find the manager because after everything that had happened we were not happy how the situations were handled. He explained to the manager that it wasn&amp;#39;t right what had happened and how we weren&amp;#39;t happy. The manager just said sorry and reluctantly offered to buy us a couple cheesecake slices after we had said something should be done and changed on the bill. No one was even going to order cheesecake so we left irritated that nothing was done to handle the problem. Two of the people in our party did end up getting cheesecake but they ended up paying for it so the manager ended up literally doing nothing for us. <br&gt;<br&gt;All of these issues could have been resolved if the hosts,server and manager had communicated effectively with each other and us. I can understand a wait and something coming out wrong but what I don&amp;#39;t understand is the lack of genuine apologetic concern. We&amp;#39;ve all worked in the service industry so we get it.

I mean, if you want a crowd pleaser I&amp;#39;d recommend going here.<br&gt;<br&gt;I love the cobb salad. With bits of bacon, diced up eggs, avocado slices, chunks of chicken (to be honest, I can do without that but I&amp;#39;ll take what I can get), blue cheese crumbles....ahhh.

For all you sweet-savory-salty people out there...this is an ABSOLUTE must. The steak is extremely tender and the mashed potatoes gives you the pleasant surprise of the occasional chunk of unmashed potato in it.

Firstly, I believe their atmosphere and theme to be silly and derivative, and secondly, I&amp;#39;d rather spend my money on an establishment where the money flows more directly into the community. With that said, I recently visited the Cheesecake Factory at the Perimeter Mall and it warrants a review, for reasons both good and not so good. <br&gt;<br&gt;To begin with, the interior of the restaurant looks like something one would find at Disneyworld - this is to say somewhat cute, an obvious attempt to come across as attractive. I don&amp;#39;t even know where to begin to describe the d\u00e9cor or this place - it had fake columns reminiscent of the Classical world, \u00a0carved faces in the fashion of the Aztecs and Mayans, and painted ceilings resembling poor man&amp;#39;s imitation of Michelangelo. Weird, but not outright unattractive. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Cheesecake Factory is always busy and doesn&amp;#39;t take reservations on weekend nights during peak \u00a0hours. This means you will wait for 15 - 30 minutes to be seated. That&amp;#39;s not so bad, but even though the restaurant is quite large, it&amp;#39;s also cramped and loud making conservation quite difficult. The service is definitely friendly. I was asked, &amp;#34;How are you tonight, sir?&amp;#34; multiple times (which I presume to be a dictat from on high to the staff) but it&amp;#39;s not very snappy, either. This is to be expected and forgiven in such a busy establishment, though. That said, it&amp;#39;s not somewhere I&amp;#39;d recommend you go out for a date night or an intimate and relaxing dinner. <br&gt;<br&gt;The menu is very extensive, almost overwhelming. Personally, I prefer a restaurant that trims downs it menu and focuses on doing several things very well, but the Cheesecake Factory takes the opposite, broader approach. \u00a0Now, to the most important part - the food. It&amp;#39;s nothing to write home about but I certainly didn&amp;#39;t leave hungry, either. I had the fried macaroni balls for the appetizer - rich and filling, and chicken pot stickers for dinner. I&amp;#39;ve certainly had better pot stickers, but they were quite good, served with a slightly crispy shell, chicken and seasoned with ginger soy sauce. I cleaned my plate and have no real complaint to deliver about the fare, but no accolades, either. <br&gt;<br&gt;The drinks are a bit on the pricey end of normal. The house wine is $8.00 and the Lemon Drop I ordered was $10. Not outrageous, but more than what one would pay at a similar corporate chain restaurant. <br&gt;<br&gt;Finally, the place is called Cheesecake Factory for a reason. Numerous varieties of that delicious pastry are available and if you like them as much as do I, you won&amp;#39;t be disappointed. Personally, the Red Velvet is my favorite, but I plan on trying the numerous other varieties over time.<br&gt;<br&gt;Finally, The Cheesecake Factory is a \u00a0restaurant that does what it does without having a unique experience and serves good, though not exceptional food. I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend going out of your way to eat here, but if you know what you&amp;#39;re getting into, and want to take home a delicious cheesecake for a midnight snack, give it a shot. <br&gt;<br&gt;Pros: CHEESECAKES. Extensive menu means that even pick eaters will be able to find something they enjoy.<br&gt;<br&gt;Cons: Not much to offer in terms of ambiance, and while the food food is nominally good, nothing stands.<br&gt;<br&gt;Verdict: Recommended IF someone else is paying, or a group can&amp;#39;t decide what kind of good to eat that night.", "rating": 3, "date": "3/6/2014"}, {"text": "I have to agree with most everyone on here.

It is a &amp;#34;Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad&amp;#34; as described on their menu. It was good, however, I&amp;#39;m not a fan of the thin fried chicken &amp;#34;steaks&amp;#34; or patties. The pasta was good, surprisingly, with the arugula salad (that I mixed with it). It also comes with a thinly sliced ham on top of the salad. The server described it as &amp;#34;pork&amp;#34;. Overall, it was pretty good. I still had a lot left over because the portions are really big. My boyfriend ordered thai chicken pasta which was very delish. It is cooked with green and &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; pasta with chunks of chicken with bean sprouts. Sort of like pad thai. We also ordered the calamari as an appetizer. It is one of the best calamari I&amp;#39;ve ever had. It comes with marinara and tartar sauce. My boyfriend ordered the coke and tequila mixed (coke &amp;amp; jose cuervo) drink which he didn&amp;#39;t think was mixed well. <br&gt;<br&gt;Also, the cheesecake here is very good also. I didn&amp;#39;t order it this time for we brought in a birthday cake. Their dessert menu is very extensive. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I had a great experience and it was well worth my money since you get large portions that you could eat for the next day.", "rating": 5, "date": "11/11/2011"}, {"text": "This place is always pack, no matter what time of day you think is their down time... there truly aren&amp;#39;t any.

Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations, so it was a bit difficult to be seated since half the party showed up almost an hour late (better late than never, though!). We were among the first to arrive and went ahead and gave them a head count of 15-20. It actually wasn&amp;#39;t too long until the tables were ready, but in order to be seated, we had to have at least 8 people present. At the time, we didn&amp;#39;t, so we made the executive decision to give up our table and wait until they could get enough seating again later. It was a shame, because they actually held our table for about 40 minutes. If only people would just show up on time. The staff was extremely understanding, accommodating and kept us informed throughout the duration of our wait. 5-star service right there, folks.<br&gt;<br&gt;Fast forward an hour later, and a few moments after the final guests arrived, our new seating arrangement was ready for us. Here&amp;#39;s the rundown:<br&gt;<br&gt;Service: Our two waiters were friendly and came by often enough for refills on everything but water, for some reason. Overall, not bad.<br&gt;<br&gt;Drinks: Frozen drinks were good; I&amp;#39;d recommend the Georgia Peach. Mixed drinks ($10) were okay but they were mostly ice and not enough of the drink itself. Just request for a little bit of ice and you&amp;#39;ll be good to go. One buddy of mine ordered his usual Crown on the rocks ($12) and received some sort of mixed Crown concoction. The color was VERY off and it tasted extremely light. Skip on getting anything on the rocks, because they seem to cheat you of your spirits.<br&gt;<br&gt;Food: For the bigger foodies, we thought the dishes were very.. mediocre / subpar. For those who don&amp;#39;t get out nearly as often, they thought it was great! Food portions were giant (that&amp;#39;s their signature thing) except for the &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; plates. So, keep that in mind when you order.. whether you have a big appetite or not. I got their crowd pleasing Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (according to the menu) but I found it to be very bland and the shrimp was overcooked and tough. If you come here, I&amp;#39;d suggest sticking to ordering small plates / appetizers and desserts only. I can&amp;#39;t remember a time when I thought any entree was bomb[dot]com.<br&gt;<br&gt;For small plates / appetizers, I recommend:<br&gt;1. Vietnamese Tacos. It&amp;#39;s not authentic, and it&amp;#39;s pretty much a glorified, Americanized version of a banh mi. It was interesting, but pretty darn delicious nonetheless.<br&gt;2. Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip. You can never go wrong with any sort of cheese dip to start off your dinner!<br&gt;3. Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. D and I got these on a whim when we were here before and it&amp;#39;s probably my most favorite thing off their entire menu! However, much to my disappointment, it wasn&amp;#39;t there or I overlooked it, in search of it ten times over.<br&gt;<br&gt;For desserts, I recommend:<br&gt;1. Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake. There are layers of red velvet cake and cheesecake, combined to create this piece of heaven. It was sweet, but not overly sweet. Simply put: it was perfect!<br&gt;2. OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake. This one is new, and an amped up version of their OREO cheesecake they offered before.<br&gt;3. Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel. I thought getting something with fruit in it would make me feel less guilty about ordering a dessert. Nope! This one is actually the sweetest tasting of the three I suggested. Surprising, huh?<br&gt;<br&gt;There is no free dessert for birthdays (darn!) but they do write a pretty message on your plate and come by to sing happy birthday.

The restaurant was empty because it just opened therefore my motto is, if it don&amp;#39;t feel right, just go.<br&gt;<br&gt;2nd occasion, March 22nd, 2017. \u00a0We went after shopping and the wait was not long, maybe 15mins; \u00a0It was me, my son and girlfriend. \u00a0My Waiter-Marcus came and we ordered our drinks, food, and appetizer. \u00a0Everything rolling along fine until we placed our order. \u00a0Appetizer came out within 15mins, after that radio silence. My girlfriend ordered the turkey burger, I ordered the Gumbo, and my son order the Filet Mignon, therefore we were spending a good amount of money w/ drinks. \u00a0After 25-30 mins, we looking around like where is the food; Marcus comes by and says nonchalantly let me check on your food. \u00a0About 5 mins later (30-35 total), \u00a0turkey burger came and Gumbo. I ordered my gumbo w/ white rice which sits in the middle of the bowl, this one had brown rice. I told the server I order Gumbo w/ white rice. The server said here I will bring you out some white rice, I said no take this back, that is not what I ordered. He stated it only sits in the middle. \u00a0I am like, did he just try and give me a different version of what I order and wanted me to make the adjustments on the plate that I am paying for. \u00a0I told him to take the plate back and bring it out correctly. \u00a0During this point our server Marcus is no-where to be found in response to the mishap. \u00a0And notice, I did not mention my sons plate, because he hasn&amp;#39;t received it. \u00a0So now, here comes my corrected Gumbo w/ white rice, no apology or anything. \u00a0Also here comes the Filet Mignon w/ mashed potatoes and green beans.
