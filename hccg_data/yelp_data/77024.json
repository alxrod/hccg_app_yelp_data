We were told that it&amp;#39;ll be a 25 minute wait but were seated in less than 5!<br&gt;<br&gt;Food/Drink- Started with the buffalo bites (no photos- sorry!) and those were basically fried chicken balls with a side of buffalo sauce and blue cheese. They were HUGE. Honestly, they could have been a meal. Between two people, we still had 4 pieces left. You also get a thing of bread while you wait for your entree (pumpernickel &amp;amp; white). I also had the crispy chicken costoletta. It was really good and was bursting with flavor. The only thing I would change was the amount of sauce you get. The sauce amount is very minimal and I feel like it really adds to the flavor, so I&amp;#39;d recommend just asking for extra. The chicken was thin, a crispy golden brown and had the perfect texture. The mashed potatoes were creamy, flavorful and still had the skins, which I LOVE. For dessert, dun dun dun... I had the celebration cheesecake and my oh my was it good! It&amp;#39;s celebration cake with a layer of cheesecake in the middle and cake crumbs on the outside. It tasted like a higher class birthday cake + cheesecake! It was delicious and a perfect way to end my meal. For my drink, I had the guava daiquiri and that was good as well. Nice and fruity, fresh and a tangy all in one. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ambiance/Service- The inside is really nice with tile flooring and pretty decor. The only thing I don&amp;#39;t like about the inside is the lighting. It&amp;#39;s very yellow and quit unflattering but I guess it&amp;#39;s what makes it unique.

I like Mint! So very refreshing! <br&gt;2. The Tex-Mex Eggrolls- They are not Chili&amp;#39;s, but BETTER! Great flavor and lots of them! Shareable! <br&gt;3. Chicken sliders- Totally beats Popeyes chicken sandwiches anyways and they don&amp;#39;t run out. Lol <br&gt;4. The Potstickers- To die for! My next best go to outside of P.F.

Me and my daughter went inside to the hostess stand with 2 American girl dolls in hand. The hostess greeted us and gave us one of them little buzzer things. I inquired about sitting outside on their covered patio which was rather empty except for one couple dining out there. She said she would check on it for us and said she would see if there were any tables available. I was very confused at that last statement because I could clearly see ALL tables were available except for the one being occupied by one couple. I played along and sat outside on a bench for about ten minutes. Finally she took us outside to a small rickety rocky table for two. I kinda gave her the side eye but said thank you and sat. We were not getting off to a good start but I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt and no one was going to ruin my good mood and this beautiful day with my daughter.<br&gt;<br&gt;As we looked over our menus, our server approached us. Very friendly and noticed right away that we had 2 American Girl dolls dining with plus and thoughtfully asked if we would like doll chairs for our dolls. I was very happy, surprised and impressed that they offered AG doll chairs. It&amp;#39;s very smart on their part to be so inclusive since the restaurant is so close to the doll store. Our server, Meketa W. was very attentive and nice. I actually forgot about the hiccups with the hostess. It&amp;#39;s amazing how good service can turn things around. She also noticed how cramped we were at the tiny table for two and offered to move us to a larger table in the center of the patio. It gave us and the dolls a lot more room. That was super thoughtful and I appreciated that. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer.My daughter ordered the chicken tenders from the kids menu and I ordered the egg roll sampler as my entree. We also ordered the celebration cake cheesecake as our dessert to go. The chicken tenders were amazing! I ate one of hers and whatever batter they use is light and crispy but so good. My egg rolls overall were pretty good. A couple of them were a little hard (overcooked) but still edible. Overall, I give this dining visit 4 stars.

I get up and ask the dirty girl at the front to speak to the manager she goes and gets the manager and Min comes to our table and explain the situation and he says he will look into it and he comes back and says our food is out next, ummmmm ok why did people who came after us get their food? He offers dessert, which made me laugh like why would I want dessert? I came here to eat food. So we wait cuz apparently we are next. I see him on the other side talking to another table, for a good 7 min. My friend approaches him because according to min it was about another 5 minutes. Literally MIN side eyes my friend and runs back to the kitchen completely ignoring my friend. So my friend comes back and we decide let&amp;#39;s wait 5 min and see, we see MR Min in the kitchen talking to the cooks and it was obvious our food was NOT EVEN CLOSE TO READY. I also see the waitress in the back with him not giving a shit about life. We stand up from our seats and we see an employee walking by, I ask her to speak to the manager because it&amp;#39;s been over an hour now we haven&amp;#39;t received our food, Danielle was so nice about the situation and apologized even though it was NOT her fault at all and said that an another table had an issue that he was taking care of but I told her we are going to leave as we are starving.So my friend goes back again and as soon as MIN was about to run off to the back my friend yells loudly Excuse meeeee and my friend says we don&amp;#39;t want the food we are leaving, so MR min says are you sure it&amp;#39;s almost ready (bullshit) so my friend says no we don&amp;#39;t want it!

It was over an hour... waiting in the sweltering heat. <br&gt;<br&gt;As we were waiting to be seated, I couldn&amp;#39;t help but look around... and I was not real keen on the crowd that was in the restaurant. There were people there in wife-beaters and flip flops... just seemed trashy. <br&gt;<br&gt;I will say that the wait staff was excellent... the bartender that waited on us for the hour before we were finally seated was pleasant and the waiter we had was very attentive and nice. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food was ok, and really just not as good as I&amp;#39;ve had at other locations. For the main course, I had the chicken chipotle pasta. It was pretty tasty, but lacking in a few areas... the asparagus, for instance, was clearly undercooked. I had to eat around it and then found myself wishing that they had made it correctly becuase the dish lacked without it. <br&gt;<br&gt;We were so uncomfortable, we ended the dinner abruptly and skipped out on the cheesecake... I doubt we will ever return to this location. <br&gt;<br&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Not the best Cheesecake Factory...

My friend asked her guests to attend a birthday dinner here with reservations at 8PM.

Because CF does not take reservations! \u00a0I was highly surprised by this since Grand Lux Cafe in the Galleria takes reservations and they are a sister company of The Cheesecake Factory. From what my friend told me, she knew about there being no reservations, but she arrived early to request a table and she was told that getting a table inside the restaurant \u00a0would demand at least a TWO HOUR WAIT!<br&gt;<br&gt;Must be a joke--not even feasible. Instead they told her they could get a table for her on the patio--it just needed to be cleaned up. I guess the cleaning supplies was stolen by the Tooth Fairy because we still were not seated until 9. and guess where we ended up being seated?<br&gt;<br&gt;Inside. By the bar. They finally used their heads and pushed some bar tables together to accommodate our group. Only problem with bar tables are the high as a kite bar seats. I felt like a pregnant woman in her final trimester trying sit in the chair and scoot it up close enough to sit at the table comfortably. It was a struggle!!! <br&gt;<br&gt;At this point, I was pretty much over the desire to dine at CF. I had perused the menu before I came to save time, but nothing really enticed my taste buds. After the wait, all I needed was a glass of water and complimentary bread and butter to make it to my next destination. <br&gt;<br&gt;Seriously, CF needs to consider some sort of reservation system. We came on a Friday night, which is going to be busy. However, their sister company Grand Lux, has a steady flow of patrons and allows them to reserve seating--giving them 15 minutes grace before releasing the table. They&amp;#39;re not losing business with a reservation system. CF could use the same protocol to give patrons a chance to dine at their establishment as well.

My sister &amp;amp; I were having a nice casual dinner, and celebrating her birthday. Nothing out of the ordinary. The appetizer was excellent (crab bites), not too picky about food either. Our waiter was very attentive (his name was Nathan, I believe.), and provided the best service possible. We ordered our food, and mine came first. My sister notices hers is taking a little longer, and all of the sudden the manager(she was a blonde lady, I didn&amp;#39;t catch her name.) comes up to us and apologizes and lets us know there was a mix up in the kitchen with my sisters plate, that the order was made wrong, and in result, the chef had to make another plate. The manager not only offered an apology, but she gave us the plate that was wrong to go, also gave my sister a free salad while she waited for the correct dish, and then to seal the deal and her birthday, they blessed us with a free cheesecake on the house.

Hungry but not sure what I want? CF&amp;#39;s huge menu would satisfy any craving from super sweet to savory. In general, all their franchises serve pretty good food - not great but pretty consistent. <br&gt;<br&gt;Here was the problem with tonight&amp;#39;s visit. Went with a friend, had grilled artichokes, avocado salad, miso salmon, decaf coffee and 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake. \u00a0All the food was OK. We were not offered bread but then again, I could have just asked for it. Then came the bill....<br&gt;<br&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t help but notice a glaring tipping guide highlighted in bright orange. For me, this was very odd. Out of everything, my server felt the need to highlight the tipping guide. I don&amp;#39;t know why she felt the need to do this so I kindly asked for a manager. I asked the manager if it was customary for waiters to highlight the bills. She said yes. I asked which particular parts are typically highlighted. She said the tipping guide! Then she went on to explain to me that since Obama got rid of the mandatory service charges of parties over 6, they started to highlight the tipping guide. I didn&amp;#39;t quite understand the reasoning or explanation but verified that all the servers typically highlight it for everyone regardless of party size. There is no way to see if she&amp;#39;s telling the truth but I&amp;#39;d like to know if other yelpers have seen this before. Perhaps I&amp;#39;m just making a big deal over nothing?<br&gt;<br&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what really gets me. My server highlighted the tipping guide on all 3 copies of my bill. It didn&amp;#39;t sit well with me and left a very bad taste in my mouth. There are not many times where I feel openly discriminated, but in this case, I felt like I was given a tipping lesson and for what reason?<br&gt;<br&gt;I thanked the manager for verifying that this is the restaurant&amp;#39;s normal practice. The waiter came back and very abruptly said &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m sorry if I offended you&amp;#34;. I said &amp;#34;no, you shouldn&amp;#39;t be sorry. Your manager just confirmed that your restaurant does this with all the tables. I just don&amp;#39;t really understand why&amp;#34;. She said that it saves the customer time from having to pull out their phone and calculate the tip. I told her even if she didn&amp;#39;t highlight it, it is very obvious on the bill. <br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, if everyone is treated like this, I think CF should rethink their policies.

Our dishes came out, and the first thing I notice in my open burger were onions coming off the side. The server just dropped the plates and ran off. I was able to wave him down after about 3 minutes and tell him. He then took my plate and brought me a new one (which I believe they just pulled the onions off of the same burger) but it&amp;#39;s okay. 3 out of the 6 of us ordered burgers with sides of French fries. All 3 of our orders of fries were not only stale, but as you got to the center of them, were literally frozen cold. I&amp;#39;m guessing they use frozen fries which is not a huge problem, but at the very least cook them all the way through. We weren&amp;#39;t able to tell our server immediately because he wasn&amp;#39;t back for another 15-20 minutes. Once he finally made it back, we told him about the frozen fries. He proceeded to ask if we wanted a replacement or just a different side. Our plates were completely finished (other than the fries that had barely been touched), why would we just want to finally get a fresh side?

He says &amp;#34;oh cool&amp;#34; and continues clearing plates. He looks at her and asks &amp;#34;do you want a cheesecake or some type of dessert?&amp;#34; She says yes that&amp;#39;d be great. He brings her a cheesecake with a candle and sings happy birthday blah blah blah. Immediately after singing, he asks us who&amp;#39;s tab is he charging the cheesecake to. Confused, my girlfriend looks up and says just to just add it to ours. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now I know separate checks can be confusing, but we told him from the beginning to separate the tabs by table (it was the three couples). After some waiting, he finally brings the checks which are literally messed up in every aspect possible. I then asked for a manager to come get it situated and to let them know about everything that had happened during the meal. The manager even took about 20 minutes to come. During that time, the server came back and took the checks to fix them. I know managers can get busy, so not a huge deal. At this time, we&amp;#39;re waiting for our fixed checks to come back. I tell the manager about our ENTIRE experience and she says &amp;#34;Next time you just need to get us involved earlier so we can make sure after the first mess up that you&amp;#39;re being taken care of.&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t aware that if I go out to eat at The Cheesecake Factory, I have to request to be taken care of by a manager just to get a decent meal with decent service.

To be honest, the only thing I really like about CF is the cheesecake, but their massive entree menu always gives me reason to believe that I&amp;#39;ll find a diamond in the rough. <br&gt;<br&gt;This time, I put my bet on the fish tacos, which I ordered fried. I envisioned a light, crunchy, and flavorful snack, but I should have known better. My enormous platter came loaded with four fish tacos, each tucked to the brim with a large and greasy battered fish nugget on a bed of mayo-saturated veggies. The taco shells consisted of two soft corn shells each, which I understand for the purpose structural integrity. However, all of this amounted to an overwhelming amount of subpar food for me. The tacos really could have used some crunchier veggies and maybe a tangy dipping sauce like salsa to brighten them up. Also, there was guac in the tacos, but so little that they might as well have left it out. The dish came with unexciting sides of black beans and dry, hard herbed rice. My mom ordered the Chicken Madeira, which really fared no better. We could only each finish half of our meal, and even at that point were close to exploding. <br&gt;<br&gt;The cheesecake was the saving grace of the meal, as expected. I got an Oreo extreme dream cheesecake, and yes, it was as dense and uber rich as it sounds, but it was well worth it. Awesome choice if you love chocolate! And I&amp;#39;m not afraid to admit that my favorite part is always the whipped cream. <br&gt;<br&gt;The service was aight.

It wasn&amp;#39;t too crowded; the wait was only about 10 minutes. There is an awesome patio area outside where we sat and waited for our table. Once seated, we were greeted by out server. He was a young guy, very polite and helpful. For my appetizer, I chose the Ahi tuna Carpaccio. This is an amazing dish that punches your taste buds with powerful flavors. I must warn though, it is rather pricey for such a small, thin cut of tuna. I still stand by my recommendation, however, because it has amazing flavor. The thin slice of Ahi tuna comes covered in a wasabi pesto, garnished with creamy avocado and togarashi aioli (whatever that is.) <br&gt;<br&gt;For my main course, I decided on the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. This is a complex dish with far too many ingredients to list here. The chicken and shrimp is packed inside a delicious curry sauce with coconut milk. There is also a peanut sauce. It comes garnished with flaked coconut, dried parsley, peanuts, and green onions. If you&amp;#39;re a fan of chicken curries or Thai food, you might enjoy this one. The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp was zesty AND sweet. There was a large portion of chicken and shrimp as well and it was very filling.<br&gt;<br&gt;There is only one bit negative feedback that I would like to announce. At one point during our meal, a random server dropped off a plate of hummus and bread to our table which we did not order. It was there for about 10 min until we mentioned that it did not belong to us. The plate was picked up and walked back into the kitchen and within seconds, the same sever walked up and served a hummus plate to the table next to us. It seemed as though he served them the same dish that had sat on our table that whole time. Maybe they had a new dish ready, but that was pretty damn fast. They should have been brought a fresh plate, but I wasn&amp;#39;t in the kitchen to see what happened.<br&gt;<br&gt;All BS aside, I enjoyed my meal and the service was excellent.

So my party of seven decided that they wanted to sit around and wait for an hour rather than go and wander the mall for that hour. We sat outside in the beautiful weather for about 30 minutes while I stared longingly at the covered patio/lounge are that was virtually empty.<br&gt;<br&gt;I finally got fed up with sitting on the hard bench (back problems) and marched up to the hostess to ask her if we could sit in the lounge area while we waited.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ran back outside as fast as I could in my heels to announce that yes, we could indeed sit in the lounge area. I then plopped down onto thick cushioned seats with much enthusiasm as my party followed.<br&gt;<br&gt;We were then approached by a server who informed us that we could order drinks, appetizers and desserts on the lounge and our hungry tummies decided that it was a very good idea to sit at the lounge after all. I ordered fried calamari and a glass of St. Arnolds Lawn Mower and a friend ordered Buffalo Blasts. The calamari was your usual calamari. The buffalo blast was not what I expected at all. It was deep fried cheese (the menu says there is chicken in there too but I didn&amp;#39;t taste/feel any) with buffalo sauce and blue cheese on the side. I happened to enjoy it very much.

We have a very small child in our group who needs a child cup with a little plastic lid and a straw.

Seeing everyone&amp;#39;s drink order in, she got happy and wanted her juice, and then she began to cry because he didn&amp;#39;t have it for her.<br&gt;<br&gt;He finally brought me my coffee and her juice, but he brought her an adult glass. We sent him back for a kiddie cup.<br&gt;<br&gt;Service after that was generally pretty slow. it was two hours before we could finally get out of the door. I never give a crappy tip, but this guy was about to get one. And then, would you believe it? We were hit with an 18% gratuity charge. I didn&amp;#39;t want to pay a penny of it! <br&gt;<br&gt;The general consensus of the table was that the food wasn&amp;#39;t so great (aside from the lettuce wrap). I ordered fish tacos. Very pretty, but bland and tasteless. I tried to squeeze some lime juice in to try and liven up the flavor a bit, but the lime crumbled into pulp and didn&amp;#39;t produce any juice. I ask for more and they all produced the same results.<br&gt;<br&gt;The only saving grace? Cheesecake. I ordered the Reese&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Cup Cake Cheesecake and the Pineapple Upside Down Cake Cheesecake and threw them in the freezer to wait there for the next time I got to see a friend. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Reese&amp;#39;s was very heavy and rich.

She said they stopped the order, but magically she came back with our food packed up and ready to go in less than 10 mins.

I especially like getting steak and there&amp;#39;s a jambalaya noodle dish. \u00a0Food is good, and I always get cheesecake for desert. One slice is so big and filling, so I usually split it with 2 or three other people!
