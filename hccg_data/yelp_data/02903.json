Heavy. Depends on what you get in terms of heaviness, but there is no &amp;#34;light.&amp;#34; There is heavy, and there&amp;#39;s heavier.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Cheesecakes are the real beast here. Delicious, but impossible to choose. You can share, but who wants to? I go for chocolatey cheesecakes (Oreo especially), but the occasional plain vanilla is also enjoyable. I&amp;#39;m happy to wait in line for a cheesecake, then make my wall through the mall. <br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s never not busy, so getting a table can be a hassle. <br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s also very, very dark at night, and hard to read the menu, even with glasses.

Except for yesterday (3/16) so we decided to check it out. <br&gt;<br&gt;Busy but only waited less than five minutes for a table. Our waiter was funny and I wish I could remember his name because he&amp;#39;d get all the props. Our drinks came out promptly and we ordered fried zucchini as an appetizer. Guess who will be trying to duplicate these in her air fryer?! This girl. They were perfectly cooked and the ranch dressing was definitely not out of a bottle. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the white chicken chili. Amazing!!! Just spicy enough and decent enough size that I got to take some home. The man got buffalo chicken sandwich and he said the buffalo sauce was too mild but it was really good otherwise and he absolutely loved the ranch dressing. The boy got a kids mac and cheese which I was weary off because so many places serve Kraft. I can eat that at home for a dollar. I needn&amp;#39;t have worried because it was definitely freshly made in house and enough left over for him to bring some home too.<br&gt;<br&gt;The two cons I had were that we were seated next to the kitchen so it was extremely loud. It didn&amp;#39;t bother me the entire visit but there were a few kitchen moments that made it ear shattering. And the price. I lost my mind at the price. While we both had two drinks a piece, the tab skyrocketed to 88.00. Even if we both drank water, it would definitely still be too expensive of a place for us to frequent which is a bummer because the menu was GIANT and the food was EXCELLENT. However I don&amp;#39;t know that we will be back soon because that is definitely a &amp;#34;treat ourselves&amp;#34; kind of restaurant. Again, this bums me out.

It&amp;#39;s probably my favorite out of the chain restaurants, not only for the fun atmosphere, but also for the extensive and delicious menu offerings! It could take you a lifetime to eat through everything they have here, and that&amp;#39;s kind of awesome. <br&gt;<br&gt;I especially enjoy the Skinnylicious Menu, since I have lost 100 lbs in the last year, and it&amp;#39;s wonderful to be able to eat at a favorite restaurant while still staying on track. Members of Weight Watchers, take note! The Tuscan Chicken is a huge and flavorful portion of tender balsamic marinated chicken served with pesto and cherry tomatoes, and only 4 points! The Mexican Chicken Lettuce Wraps are my favorite appetizer, and come brimming with grilled chicken, roasted corn, avocado, and black beans, and are 3 points for the whole dang thing. AND they even have health conscious takes on classic cocktails, like a Cosmo or a Mojito. Where else can you get a Mojito for 4 points? Answer: You can&amp;#39;t. That&amp;#39;s just skimming the surface of some of the amazing things on that Skinnylicious Menu, but it&amp;#39;s absolutely worth checking out because none of the many items sacrifice flavor or quality for healthfulness.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you are able to indulge in the full menu, take a gander at the Potato Puffs, which are fried potato balls stuffed with bacon and cheese and served with a tangy ranch dip. That&amp;#39;s the stuff that dreams are made of. They also have a popular Spinach Artichoke Dip, which is one of the best ones available at chain restaurants, served piping hot and gooey with melted cheese. You can easily make a meal out of appetizers here, but if you&amp;#39;re in the mood for an entree, I love the Chicken Picatta, served with a creamy lemon butter sauce (it&amp;#39;s 5% lemon, 95% butter, just as God intended), or the Chicken Parmesan Pizza, which has everything you love about pizza, but instead of the crust, it&amp;#39;s a giant breaded, fried chicken cutlet. So great for Instagram, but remember to bring your selfie light for photos, because it&amp;#39;s dark AF in here.<br&gt;<br&gt;Save room for dessert! Of course, you&amp;#39;ll want some cheesecake, like the incredible Mango one that has a coconut macaroon crust instead of the traditional graham cracker, or the Celebration cheesecake that&amp;#39;s like a birthday cake gone wild, with several layers of funfetti cake, and chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry cheesecake. However, don&amp;#39;t overlook the other dessert options, like the Strawberry Shortcake, served with fresh whipped cream and flaky biscuits, or the Chocolate Fudge Cake, which is as decadent as it sounds and perfect for sharing (or not!) The only complaint is that there is a lack of Skinnylicious dessert options. Give me a cheesecake shooter! Give me a mini portion of fudge cake! Something! Anything! PLEASE. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to come with a group, but be prepared to wait if you&amp;#39;re visiting on peak weekend evenings.

Took about 10 minutes but quick seating. Our server was Christopher L. and he was great. Funny, attentive, friendly. Excellent. The food took about 25-30 minutes, not bad at all. It was busy in the restaurant and the food was hot. The impossible burger was no less than perfect! My mom thought it was beef. We all really enjoyed our food. I asked for it with no seasoning this time and it is back to being the best impossible burger in the city. Thanks!!<br&gt;<br&gt;OLD REVIEW: <br&gt;Now I&amp;#39;ll start by saying I think cheesecake has the best version of the impossible burger for the buck. It&amp;#39;s $15 with fries, but is absolutely HUGE. I think they put double patty together. Everywhere else the impossible burger is $12-15 but is small, about the size of a BK burger. Here, it&amp;#39;s great. However the last two times I ordered it it was NOT good. They seasoned the burger with SOOO much seasoning I could physically see the seasonings on the patty. It had so much salt I couldn&amp;#39;t even finish it. It was undercooked. It was one of the most horrible things I&amp;#39;ve ever put in my mouth. I knew this was a fluke because I&amp;#39;ve had it here at least 10 times. When I ordered it again a few days ago, I mentioned with the order I didn&amp;#39;t want any additional seasoning and please cook it thoroughly. Again, the burger was loaded with salt. It was cooked this time. But loaded with salt. Very disappointing. This may no longer be my favorite impossible burger spot. Sad because I live right across the street from it.", "rating": 5, "date": "7/8/2019"}, {"text": "Not a bad visit at all on a busy day with family. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food got to our table quick, drink refills and breads too.

Who can resist taking a piece of cheesecake to go? There&amp;#39;s dozens of flavors and varieties to choose from, so pick something that sounds good and enjoy! <br&gt;<br&gt;Pro tip:<br&gt;Sit in the bar area between 4:00 - 6:00pm Monday-Thursday and ask for their special bar menu.

One confirms cream and sugar with the coffee, leaves for it and never comes back!<br&gt;-I have to ask for a refill of Coke, comes as we are done eating. <br&gt;-New waiter brings check that was supposed to be split, but old waitress never told new waiter details. Now we have to go through bill with him as to who had what so he can redo it. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food was ok, the cheesecake was awesome, but the service was so bad that it ruined our experience.

The sauce soaked in the tomatoes and the farro was mouthwatering. I absolutely devoured the tomatoes. However, the chicken itself was not cooked that well and was very hard to break it off. It also didn&amp;#39;t really have a taste which was surprising because you would have hoped that the sauce soaked into it. I think there are better things on the menu. <br&gt;<br&gt;GET THE WHITE CHOCOLATE CARAMEL MACADAMIA NUT CHEESECAKE:So the group I was with for the most part we were all trying to be healthy but this was something we could not resist. The nuts are a perfect compliment to the smoothness that is cheesecake and every bite only left you wanting more. I love white chocolate so perhaps I may be biased but 4/4 of us said we would order it again. <br&gt;<br&gt;Key Lime Cheesecake: THis didn&amp;#39;t hit the home run quite so much. It definitely was strong in the key lime flavor so don&amp;#39;t expect anything else.

This incident happened last night 06/23/2017.<br&gt;<br&gt;It started with me and my friends waiting for 5 mins to 10 minutes to be noticed by a receptionist . There was no one at the reservation table. After asking a guy who was adjusting the menu, he helped us out and got us seated in 10 mins which was a pretty quick service. <br&gt;<br&gt;There comes our waiter- tries his best to show off with his specials menu and then asks for a drink. Once the drinks are placed he hurries us for the order, at that point my friends and I order appetizers and were in no mood for entree. The guy gives this nasty look which my friend feels offended . I brushed it off saying he \u00a0probably didn&amp;#39;t mean anything. Once we were in the middle of our appetizers he comes back and asks for anything else. At that point I ask him for dessert recommendations. He points at the menu on the table next to me and says give me the menu. I was taken back and offended by way he asked (rude and demanding) and when I asked him dessert recommendations again, he repeats three times to give him the menu on the table . There was no please or may I have the menu please?. At that point I was furious after handing him the menu and he turns to the picture on the menu and says I wanted to show this. This is all in his condescending, arrogant attitude. I wasn&amp;#39;t sure what his problem was, I am not sure if it was because we were brown skin ( this is the first time ever I had encountered this kind of incident ever) . I didn&amp;#39;t want to confront him for his behavior , I politely asked him to call his manager. By the way the waiter name is Anthony. <br&gt;<br&gt;Manager showed up and said he was sorry on behalf of the waiter . I asked for a different waiter/waitress which he did. (the new waitress was courteous and professional and even apologized at the end for his colleagues behavior) .I asked the manager if there is going to be any follow up about what action he will be taking, he didn&amp;#39;t have an answer. I insisted I would like to know and I will be posting a review on yelp for response. Manager told me I could post one but he can&amp;#39;t answer to it . <br&gt;<br&gt;I am not sure what policies does cheese cake factory has to deal with this kind of behavior by one of their staff members.

He did not come back to take our order until 15-20 minutes later. Then he disappeared for another 15-20 minutes, returning finally with drinks and our appetizer. We tell him our order, which we ordered several slices of their cheesecakes for all of us to sample. <br&gt;The slices are huge and they tasted amazing but when he came back he just dropped off our cakes and walked off but back back two minutes later with the entire staff to sing happy birthday to another table across from us. <br&gt;They looked completely stunned because they did not request nor had a birthday in their party.

So good I couldn&amp;#39;t put my fork down , but very filling. The bread they gave in the beginning was fresh and toasted perfectly on the outside. I ordered the pizza which is cut into 10 slices and reasonably priced and filling. The dough was soft with a bit of crunch to it and just really good. Finally trying the cheesecake was just out of this world! I ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake which includes a bottom chocolate crust layer with regular cheesecake and humongous globs of cookie dough with walnuts drizzled on top and in the cookie dough. I can&amp;#39;t forget the whipped cream they put on the plate and on top of the cheesecake. Lastly the chocolate chips they sprinkled on each whipped cream circle. Why you may ask this is only four stars? If the food wasn&amp;#39;t good then this would have been another one star for me. We waited 2 hours and 32 minutes to be seated. No reservations could be made on Sunday, so we took our chances and went in at 4:15 for a 5:00 dinner. They said an hour and a Half wait so we put our name down for the next available table and we went to the mall next door and looked around. Nearing the hour and a half mark we went back to the restaurant and was told another 20 minutes. Ok another 20 minutes we can live without it. There is one small booth to wait which was filled to The max with people. So we waited and waited, our feet getting tired of standing , our stomachs grumbling and then our buzzer vibrates. We arrived at that restaurant at 4:15 and was seated at almost 7:30 with the exaggeration of only 20 minutes left. This restaurant lacks severely on their waiting times , waiting area and just front organization. It was a mad house of people, squishing In everywhere waiting. In the way of other people eating , in the way of waiters and waitresses, just complete chaos. Our server was very nice though , and checked in about every 20 seconds asking for refills. So that was good. We had two servers in the beginning but one of them went on break and forgot to tell the other one of my friend&amp;#39;s order and she got her meal while we were eating dessert. At least our other good server continued to be wonderful and asked if she wanted any bread or food to tie her over until then. One server was amazing(wish I caught her name ) , the other terrible.

See, here in Providence, there is only one Cheesecake Factory, and it is epically busy on weekends, to the point you usually have to wait an hour or two if you go around a normal dinner time. We typically get there at least twice a year, but this year, we haven&amp;#39;t gone once yet!

We ordered it spicy, and while it wasn&amp;#39;t really, it did have a nice kick that reared itself periodically. It was uber-flavorful though- way better than any store-bought guac I have tried, and honestly, it was better than the guac I get at my favorite Providence Mexican restaurant!<br&gt; <br&gt;Of course, no guac is complete without an endless supply of salty, crunchy tortilla chips!<br&gt; <br&gt;For dinner, I ordered their &amp;#34;Skinnylicious&amp;#34; fresh vegetable salad. Now a word on this &amp;#34;Skinnylicious&amp;#34; business- I think the only difference between this and their regular fresh vegetable salad is the pomegranate dressing is low-fat in the Skinnylicious version. Honestly, I could have cared less if I got the Skinnylicious version or the regular one, but since the lower-fat option was available, I went with it. <br&gt; <br&gt;I did make some changes to the original salad- I asked that they leave off the cheese and grilled chicken, and instead add some pecans and dried cranberries. Out waitress warned us there was an extra charge for that, which I thought was silly because I was essentially just making swaps, but whatever- I did it anyway!<br&gt; <br&gt;The salad was. . . astoundingly gigantic, to say the least! It was an awesome mix of greens, edamame (yay for vegan protein in a chain restaurant salad!), apple, cucumber, tomato, green beans, beets, pecans and cranberries. Everything was chopped into perfect bite-sized bits, and the pom dressing covered every single component perfectly. I have to say, this salad was epic (been using that word a lot in this post!) and incredible and I am sad I was only able to eat about a sixth of it! \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;The reason I couldn&amp;#39;t devote my full appetite to the salad was because my husband and I made an ordering oopsie. He got a burger, and asked that the fries be on a separate plate so I could have some. However, I had my eyes set on sweet potato fries, so of course, I ordered them too! <br&gt;<br&gt;You figured out what our oopsie was right? Talk about over-ordering! My order of sweet potato fries was about double the size of the ones he got, which in and of themselves were quite plentiful in the fry department! In other words, we had fries up the ying-yang, and since they don&amp;#39;t come home as leftovers as well as my salad would, I had to prioritize and keep my focus on fry consumption. Ok, when you have fries this crispy-on-the-outside and gooey on the inside, perhaps my dilemma wasn&amp;#39;t entirely so bad! I ate a load of fries, and they were so tasty, but truth be told, there still was a load or two left!<br&gt; <br&gt;I am upset with myself that my stomach shut down so quickly. \u00a0On a good day, I could have eaten so much more of those delectable sweet fries drowned in ketchup. Back in the dairy-eating days, I would always follow up my meal with a huge slice of either the peanut butter cup or Oreo cheesecake. I am actually glad (for my stomach) that I didn&amp;#39;t even have that option last night, as I don&amp;#39;t think following up that enormous meal with cheesecake is what I needed at all!<br&gt; <br&gt;The Cheesecake Factory, in my opinion, is like the Bentley of chain restaurants. The food is always so consistently delicious- in all my times going there since it opened in Providence years ago, I have never had an experience with their food that was less than stellar.with their food that was less than stellar.

The beers took over 15 minutes to get to the table and that is another thing we were disappointed in. \u00a0The server seemed like a robot not really caring about what we wanted, but more so focusing on giving some what of an automated and typical \u00a0introduction of the menu. \u00a0She was polite; however, very slow. \u00a0We all ordered cheesecakes to go and three of us had meals to take home. \u00a0The server took each plate and wrapped them for us, but when she gave them back to us she handed them to us individually and when we all got home we realized she had given two of us the wrong meals. \u00a0We had already parted ways at this point so we weren&amp;#39;t able to switch them back. \u00a0The cheesecake was very good as it always is. \u00a0I had the red velvet cheesecake and Tori had the Oreo cheesecake and they were both very good. \u00a0Honestly this place has changed since it began and not in a good way. \u00a0Overall the food was subpar for what you pay for, but the cheesecake was still good. \u00a0I&amp;#39;m not sure if I will come back again due to the bad service and average food, but I may be back just for the cheesecake because that is the one category they never disappoint me with.", "rating": 2, "date": "8/7/2016"}, {"text": "Great for the average college kid.<br&gt;<br&gt;Used to come here all the time on weekends for 1 serving of dinner that fed me through late Friday night to early Sunday morning.

So half of my party is already here (since my boyfriend and I arriving makes eight people) and they won&amp;#39;t even seat us? I sat down with them and my seven year old brother and one year old sister are getting restless since there is nothing for them to do and we wait for the rest of the party to get here. My grandparents call me and say they are parked but can&amp;#39;t find the restaurant because it&amp;#39;s a hike from the garage, and while I&amp;#39;m on the phone with them the hostess comes back over and says that she can only hold the table until 12:05. So I turn to her and say, &amp;#34;You are going to turn away a reservation for a party of 15 for not being here within five minutes of the reservation? In what universe does 15 people arrive at a place within five minutes of each other?&amp;#34;. She explains it&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;house policy.&amp;#34; In every restaurant we&amp;#39;ve been to, reservations are held for a courtesy of 15 minutes. My boyfriend gets off the phone with the remainder of our party, which traveled in together, and said they were walking over as we speak, and the hosts are already dismantling the table (it&amp;#39;s 12:01!). At 12:07 everyone is here and our table was dismantled, the restaurant was STILL empty, and 15 angry people walked out of the restaurant and down the street to another more conveinent location for Saturday lunch.

Please do not scream my name across a crowded, loud restaurant. <br&gt;The menu was huge and varied which was a plus for me; it seemed to have something for everyone.<br&gt;Our waitress was very nice, but definitely new. I would think with an anticipated crowd on a Friday night they would schedule a more experienced wait staff. <br&gt;After dinner we chose to get a dessert to take home. We went to the Cheesecake bar to order. This area should be stationed away from the mob waiting to hear their name yelled. There was no distinct line formed, so people stood and just looked at one another trying to see if they were next. <br&gt;<br&gt;I love the atmosphere and food. I think the service was fine but felt bad for the girl who was obviously new and \u00a0flustered. <br&gt;I would return either on a less popular night or to stand in the chaos to get take-out cheesecake; somethings you just cant pass up! lol", "rating": 4, "date": "7/9/2011"}, {"text": "Typical chain restaurant.
