Their chicken piccata dish has been completely inconsistent ranging from 2-3 &amp;#34;pieces&amp;#34; of chicken which resemble a tenderloin. The pasta is usually stuck together, sometimes the piccata sauce is on top, sometimes the capers are missing, sometimes the pasta is double, sometimes it comes in an appetizer box and sometimes it comes in a massive box with the wrong lemon butter sauce.

When I arrived with my cousin and our two 7 year olds we were seated on the &amp;#34;patio&amp;#34; at the outside corner table as soon as you walk through the doors, very visible. <br&gt;<br&gt;Per our usual we ordered the kids&amp;#39; meals first. I ordered the salmon for mine and realized that our server never asked what kind of veggies she wanted. We could see her putting the order in so I ran all the way to the other end to update her. Whew! We would&amp;#39;ve ended up with carrots and mashed potatoes, but the waiter changed it to fries and broccoli and I watched her do so. <br&gt;<br&gt;When she came back to our table she informed us that they ran out of broccoli, leaving both of our girls disappointed. My mini-me does not eat all veggies unless they are cooked a certain way so I knew any other offering would be a problem. So I asked for a small caeser salad with no cheese and we put in our app order. After the girl&amp;#39;s got their food sans the salad, the waiter said her manager was insisting on charging for the salad substitution. Really?!?! So I asked to speak to this hooligan. Smh 15 minutes later and no manager, no salad, then the waiter said she&amp;#39;d bring one and eventually she did. We put our main order in after we received our apps and waited a good 25-30 minutes for the entrees. I wish I would&amp;#39;ve taken a picture, but my meal looked like my 1st grader plated it. I ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair with a spaghetti substitution. Boo for me because I was given angel hair which to me might as well be real hair! I was still willing to eat it as long as the flavor of garlic, herbs, and basil was there as promised, but sadly no. The pasta was bland and literally tasted like tomato sauce right out of a can. The &amp;#34;saut\u00e9ed&amp;#34; shrimp, which were bone dry and placed around the plate like the numbers on a clock were also lacking seasoning. They were so white, dry and flavorless that I&amp;#39;m having a difficult time calling them shrimp and definitely NOT SAUT\u00c9ED shrimp. For two seconds I thought about taking it home and fixing it, but reality struck that there was no amount of garlic or salt and pepper to fix this $20 meal. <br&gt;<br&gt;I informed the waiter that I couldn&amp;#39;t eat it because the pasta was wrong and it lacked everything promised in the menu. I also informed her that they brought out mashed potatoes and not the french fries (luckily mini-me eat the mashed ones) as requested and that overall this was a bad experience for me. I did order cheesecake to go and told her I guess that would be my dinner. <br&gt;<br&gt;The manager never came and checked on us even after returning my meal. No one ever offered to make this right. We still tipped the waiter even though she could&amp;#39;ve been way more attentive, but she did the best she could in dealing with the situation with no support from her manager. <br&gt;<br&gt;If I return I will stick with the miso salmon I recommended to my cousin which was good and the tuna dishes which are also always very consistent.

They offer a few lemonade mixes but all seem to be a little to sweet. <br&gt;<br&gt;Most recent visit, they have added a few more items to their menu and the kids menu has plenty of different options.

The person who answered the phone assured me that I would be given a complimentary slice. This was enough for me to take the trip because who doesn&amp;#39;t want all of the bday trinkets. One star lost because an hour an a half travel later, after being seated, my waitress told me that they only offer a scoop of ice cream for birthdays, which would be fine had I not been given an another answer hours before. I did ask someone at the front and he checked with a manager and so it was true, my trip to the cheesecake factory for a birthday slice was a waste so there was that. I eventually took the ice cream scoop to go and they did try to jazz it up with sprinkles and chocolate sauce. I just would not have made the trip on this occasion to celebrate because it was a big disappointment, after all no one goes to the cheesecake factory for ice cream but I guess. I had the Chicken Bellagio for dinner and it was quite nice. The pasta was al dente, the chicken was perfectly fried and the arugula was tossed in a nice dressing! My biggest disappointment with the dish was the lack of flavor in the pasta. It was coated in a basil dressing or oil and on the sides of the plate was a cream sauce which was very well needed throughout the entire pasta part of the dish. Without it, the pasta was bland and just there. I didn&amp;#39;t have time to make any suggestions or ask for more of the sauce but maybe on my next visit, whenever that may be since it is out of the way, I will do so. Service was attentive and right. The host even prepared a table for me and truly took her time to wipe it down. That is important because some people just dont care however 1 hour until closing she gave great effort. The service is 5 stars solid but the miscommunication between customer and staff via the phone and the lack of flavor in the main part of the dish brought it down.

She apologized and called my waiter, she, without hesitation or me asking, said she will call for the manager and theyll see what they will be able to do for me- keep in mind, by that time the other people in my table have already finished the meal. <br&gt;The managar comes to the table after 3 mins \u00a0of wait. She said she was sorry about what happen and that she will be happy to pack my meal to go. As a reply I told her &amp;#34; I dont think I will be happy to pay for food that Ill have to eat without my friends&amp;#34; she then replied &amp;#34;so imma erase the meal and thats it&amp;#34; and just left. <br&gt;You had a costumer wait, for an hour watching her group eat, made a mistake on her one dish twice, and then offered nothing to make her feel better? I know no place that ever treats a costumer like that, thats one. But the second thing, is, I left \u00a0the restaurant in tears. Im a former anorexic, and Ive been through recovery. Buying food is a big deal for me, and eating outside wasnt a thing I did until last year. So facing my struggles, eating outside, making sure they understood me correctly and then feeling like no one listenes is the worst thing a place could do to someone that has been through what I did. When I eat , I prepare myself mentally for what is about to enter my body, and if that doesnt happen I just give up because to get to the point of eating outside is already hard enough. If getting your food late is furstrating, imagine you would see the food gets to you twice after a long wait but not being able to eat it. To a regular costumer its a bad experience.. so to me? Unbareable. It really is sad to me that I will not go back to the cheesecake factory restaurant. A person that is in charge should knows how to handle those things in a fair way. <br&gt;<br&gt;I came hungry and was actually the one who decided on the place.

Jersey city is right next to NYC one of the greatest cities to eat anywhere in America, so if you want to eat good food just spend 2.75 on a subway ride and go to the city. I haven&amp;#39;t had a worst experience anywhere in JC upto now. To begin with my experience we went on Thursday night at 9:30 pm for dinner. Firstly I went to the counter to ask for a table for 3 and they gave me a buzzer and told me it&amp;#39;s a 15 min wait while half of the restaurant was empty, but that&amp;#39;s ok \u00a0maybe that&amp;#39;s their policy. I waited and after 10 mins the buzzer went off, I took it to the counter and the lady took it without telling me where the table is. I was just standing there waiting for her to guide after another 10 mins I asked so where&amp;#39;s the table since you took the buzzer she tells me go stand on another side. There were 10 people who came after me and got seated before me, thank god for another server who came and asked me why are you standing here so I told him well my buzzer went off I&amp;#39;m waiting for my table, he asked for my name and told me I was looking for you since the past 10 mins we have your table ready come with me. So in short the 15 min wait turned into a 35 min wait. <br&gt;Once we got seated we were given the menus while the server took another 15 mins to come take our order. That&amp;#39;s ok but once she took the order she vanished in thin air and was nowhere to be seen for good 20 mins, by then I was done with the place so I called the manager and asked him about the update on the food he said it&amp;#39;s on it&amp;#39;s way so I politely asked him to serve us atleast the on the house bread basket, he said it should be out any min so I asked him isn&amp;#39;t that served with the menus he said yes it is I&amp;#39;ll get back to you, he went in the kitchen and never came around us again. <br&gt;So yes no bread basket was served to us, we finally got our appetizer served after 30 mins which were the nachos and they were I would say 6 on 10. The food came after another 10 mins, out of which the bang bang shrimps were awful (if I could give it a number it was -5 on 10) but the pasta was nice.

Antonella S, how can I put this nicely ? She was a horrible waiter. She seemed very nice, smiled and Took our order. Then I barely saw her. I was with two kids and my boyfriend. After the kids food came she got lost. She never brought me the water I asked for, for the whole table. She never came to bring us bread. She didn&amp;#39;t bring me the drink I ordered which was a smoothie. She comes back in what seemed like forever to me and I then had to ask her for bread because she didn&amp;#39;t seem like she was ever going to bring it and I felt like I was starving to death. Still didn&amp;#39;t bring me my water or my drink. Didn&amp;#39;t come back to check if the kids food was okay or if they needed anything. The kids are almost done with their food and she STILL didn&amp;#39;t come back with my water or bread or anything. By this point I was BEYOND frustrated and starving half to death. Another waiter by the name Yoval not sure his position but must of noticed the frustration in my face because he randomly came up to us and asked if we would want some bread. He was awesome compared to my waiter who lacked bunch of waiter skills. Then she came with my drink after she saw him helping us. Not sure if she had too many tables or if she just kept forgetting about us because she didn&amp;#39;t even apologize the times she did happen to come back. He also came around to see if we needed refills on our drinks. She came and gave us the dessert menu and then never came back. The same gentleman kept looking at us and eventually came to see what we wanted to order. Im not going to let one sour apple ruin the tree so my waiter may have been horrible at customer service but the food was BEYONDDDDDDDD GOOD.

I looked around and there wasn&amp;#39;t a trace of our server. I asked a hostess walking by if she could find our server as our food was taking long. She seemed disinterested and said she&amp;#39;d find our server. 2 minutes later wouldn&amp;#39;t you know it? The hot food finally comes out, minus my sisters lettuce wraps and edamame. Well, we wait like 5 more minutes and her meal comes out. It&amp;#39;s important to note that we STILL have not seen our server since she took our order. So I take a bite and I have to admit its pretty good, not the best meal ever but decent. Finally the sever came by and at this point we were just glad we got our food so we asked for refills and continued our meal. Then, it happened. My sister took a bite of one of the wraps and immediately spit out the chicken cause she said it tasted strange. She bit into the chicken and we saw it; the chicken was COMPLETELY raw. And what&amp;#39;s worse is that she had eaten most of it already. At this point, we proceeded to wait another 10 minutes to grab someone, anyone&amp;#39;s attention. I managed to flag down the same hostess and ask for a manager. Another 10 minutes and a manager shows up. I explain the current situation and the long wait time and the absence of our server and she simply said she&amp;#39;d take the wraps off the bill and was sorry. The server then shows up and apologized and offered dessert. We ordered a dulce de leche cheesecake to go just cause we wanted to get the hell out of there. She brought the cheesecake and the check after another 10 minutes and when I opened the check, I was appalled. The manager comped the lettuce wraps but the charge for the cheesecake was on the bill.

I recommend not eating here.", "rating": 2, "date": "6/5/2016"}, {"text": "Food: B<br&gt;The food here was awesome mostly. We started with the Fried Calamari, and it came with both a garlic aioli and cocktail sauce - super tasty - and I noticed that the squid was very tender. Every time I order fried calamari, it&amp;#39;s usually quite tough - it was ~delish~ here. The aioli, I think, consisted mainly of mayo - not complaining about, since it was SO good - but I wish it had been lighter so I didn&amp;#39;t immediately feel my arteries clog up after taking one bite. Would have loved to eat more of it. The cocktail sauce was a more refreshing alternative. I actually really enjoy fried calamari with marinara sauce, though, so I wish that they had provided that as well. For our entrees we got the Chicken Bellagio and the Herb Crusted Salmon and Shrimp Scampi combo. The chicken dish was a breaded chicken breast over angel hair pasta (with a light pesto?) topped with prosciutto and arugula. My boyfriend loved it, and it came in a large portion. He has a good appetite and didn&amp;#39;t finish it. Can&amp;#39;t say the same about my combo dish, which also came with (a small amount of) mashed potatoes. It wasn&amp;#39;t a huge problem for me since I still barely finished it - I was so full from the bread, appetizer and also barely touched the side of fries that I ordered (so unlike me). The presentation of this dish wasn&amp;#39;t impressive, since the portions were small and it was spaced out over such a large dish. But the shrimp scampi was cooked very well - the sauce was absolutely delicious. Gotta warn you though, if garlic isn&amp;#39;t your thing, I wouldn&amp;#39;t get the shrimp scampi. Luckily, I LOVE garlic. As for the salmon, meh - overcooked IMO. I like my salmon with the center still a bit tender/soft, but it was tough/crumbly. The &amp;#34;herb crusted&amp;#34; part apparently just meant that some herbs were thrown on top of it. It just didn&amp;#39;t look (or taste) that appetizing. A bit disappointing. After dinner, we ordered a slice of the chocolate mousse cheesecake to share, which we&amp;#39;ve had before, and it was super rich and chocolatey. It was very heavy, so I would recommend ordering a tall glass of milk or something on the side. I could barely eat any since I was so full already, but I really wish I could have eaten more of it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Service: A<br&gt;The service here was great - our waitress was very friendly but not intrusive. She was patient when we needed some time to look at the menu, and she was also good with timing - how much time we needed to look at the menu, when to space out our bread, appetizer, and entrees, etc. Our wine was taking a bit due to a backup at the bar, so she was kind enough to give us a heads up so we weren&amp;#39;t left wondering if it was forgotten. She checked up on us to see how our food was after giving us enough time to actually eat a bit (some waiters ask only a moment after setting the food down, and I&amp;#39;m like...I&amp;#39;ve barely touched my food yet...) Timing is a huge thing when it comes to waiting tables. Good timing makes the patrons feel comfortable, relaxed and able to enjoy their meal; poor timing gives customers an experience where they feel rushed, impatient, and/or uncomfortable or even frustrated. I distinctly noticed that she was very good at her job.<br&gt;<br&gt;Ambiance: B<br&gt;This Cheesecake Factory is a part of the Newport Mall. We were seated in the &amp;#34;patio&amp;#34; area, outside the restaurant but inside the halls of the mall. They made sure to ask to make sure it was okay to be seated here. Seems weird since people shopping at the mall walk past you, but it wasn&amp;#39;t that bad. I actually thought that we had a bit more privacy here than we would have inside, where it was super busy. I was a little concerned that because we were kind of separate from the rest of the tables, we would be forgotten (it happens) and the waitress would busy herself with the customers in the main area, but it was totally fine - our waitress was very attentive :) *thumbs up* A heads up, the patio area has patio furniture (wrought iron tables and all weather wicker sofas to sit on which was comfortable). Not everyone&amp;#39;s cup of tea - some people might like the &amp;#34;fancier&amp;#34; vibe inside, but this was totally fine for us, even better since it was quieter and we could have a conversation.<br&gt;<br&gt;Other (Sanitation): C<br&gt;When we were seated, we saw that the table had not been cleaned properly - grease marks all over. After I asked our waitress about it, she sent someone over to wipe it, and the guy apologized. Understandable since the metal that the table was made of made it hard to see whether it was a grease mark or drying water. But what was annoying after that, though, was that they later gave us spoons for our cheesecake (dessert after our meal) that were also not very clean. Both my boyfriend and I took a look at our respective spoons and dipped them into a water glass and wiped them down before we felt comfortable enough to use them... Not ideal, especially after already giving us a table that hadn&amp;#39;t been cleaned properly *thumbs down*<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I had a great time here and would come back! :)", "rating": 4, "date": "3/30/2016"}, {"text": "I have checked into the Cheesecake Factory located within the Newport Mall, the customer service so far is subpar.

Unacceptable", "rating": 1, "date": "8/4/2016"}, {"text": "This is probably the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. I usually enjoy the food and get good service at other locations, but it seems like this one can&amp;#39;t seem to figure out how to do that. My visit to this location was on 1/14 at around 7:30- the wait was 30 minutes which was fine, however the bathrooms were disgusting. I told the hostess this and asked if she could get anyone to clean them, and she said &amp;#34;no, we do that at the end of the night&amp;#34;. Well, okay, I guess the only guests that get clean bathrooms are the ones that go as soon as they open? I let it go as we were being seated, our server was awful. We asked for the bread that is normally brought out when you get seated three times, and finally got it with our appetizers. We were unable to get refills on our drinks in a timely manner, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem that hard but I guess that would have been too much for our server. Every part of the meal came out burnt, but because we had to wait so long to order our appetizers we ate them anyway. We had the fried macaroni and cheese and the Factory nachos- the Factory nachos we did not eat, the chips were black. So we order our entrees, three of the same burger- they all came out burnt, they were completely black- not the way meat should look. I try a bite of mine, end up not being able to eat it, one is untouched and the third was half eaten because our server couldn&amp;#39;t do her job and we were starving because we waited so long to order each time. 20 minutes pass as we are awkwardly sitting there waiting for our server to ask how the food is, so we can tell her there is an obvious issue. She finally comes and we ask for the manager, the manager comes and I explain the problem with our food. Normally management should respond positively, but unfortunately my valid complaints were just met with argument from this man. As I told him the nachos were burnt and clearly were mostly untouched, he says &amp;#34;no we just like to give them more crisp, they aren&amp;#39;t burnt&amp;#34;. So I pick up one of the many black chips and show it to him, where he finally agreed they were burnt. As for the burgers, we said we did not want them as we had to wait 20 minutes to even let anyone know there was a problem- the manager insists we should get new ones instead of getting them off the check because he doesn&amp;#39;t understand why we would wait so long- but finally acquiesces to take two burgers off our check. Though we still had to pay for the uneaten, burnt nachos. Maybe if the service wasn&amp;#39;t awful we would have been able to fix the many problems we had with our meal, but unfortunately the restaurant is not clean, the food is not good and management seems unable to fix guests issues.", "rating": 1, "date": "1/17/2018"}, {"text": "Went there on the first day of opening so everything was shining brand new.

I was thrilled my wallet was there and returned but the experience completely soured by the blatant lying and theft of he staff. \u00a0The manager said he would investigate it but we all know what that means.

One of the managers came over and comp&amp;#39;d one app and took the entree off the bill that had to be sent back due to length of time it took to receive the food and then the lack of break between courses.
