Back when Planet Hollywood had multiple locations all over the place. Although I guess that&amp;#39;s irrelevant now. Anyway, Cheesecake Factory is one of those places, much like Olive Garden, that I might visit once per year - not necessarily as a desire, but simply because I received a gift card for the restaurant.<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s funny, because I always read these articles about Cheesecake Factory struggling, but yet, their parking lots are always jam packed with customers. A family I work with considers them their default choice for celebrations, so clearly the place has its appeal to certain folk.<br&gt;<br&gt;Their menu, quite frankly, really freaks me out. Not necessarily because of the caloric content that they often get criticized for, but the sheer size of it. There&amp;#39;s really no real sense of direction with the menu, as it&amp;#39;s almost if they&amp;#39;re trying to cover virtually everything imaginable. If they specialize in something other than cheesecake, I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure what it is.<br&gt;<br&gt;Anyway, I decided to play it safe and ordered an old fashion burger, while my girlfriend ordered half a chicken salad sandwich, which was more than enough to feed one (normal) person. I substituted out their fries with a side of mac and cheese.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I found my burger to be comparable to what you&amp;#39;d find at most chain restaurants. Not particularly great, but not really bad either. The mac and cheese was a bit on the bland side, while my girlfriend wasn&amp;#39;t really impressed with her chicken sandwich in comparison to some of the great ones she&amp;#39;s had at some local establishments. She claimed it was just a bunch of mayo, very few almonds, and didn&amp;#39;t really taste like chicken breast. The lukewarm (loaded) potato soup was mediocre at best. On the plus side, we&amp;#39;ve both always enjoyed Cheesecake&amp;#39;s complimentary hot bread and butter.<br&gt;<br&gt;Now, as for cheesecake, I&amp;#39;ve never really been a fan in its traditional form. However, there&amp;#39;s a ridiculous amount of creations here for dessert, to the point where most people can find something that they&amp;#39;ll like. Years ago, I&amp;#39;d default to their Chocolate Tuxedo, but we decided to take a risk and go with their Hazlenut Crunch, which is topped with Nutella. It was actually decent and as good as I remember their cakes being, so that&amp;#39;s one thing that I feel this place can deliver on.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our server was very friendly and chatty, more than happy to provide her opinions on some of our menu choices. We definitely have no complaints there.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, Cheesecake Factory is what it is. It will never be a place I&amp;#39;d visit regularly, but I think that for an occasional visit, it&amp;#39;s perfectly fine. <br&gt;<br&gt;And as for their fans, I&amp;#39;d imagine that it&amp;#39;s virtually impossible to get bored with their extensive menu.", "rating": 3, "date": "6/17/2019"}, {"text": "Out of all the Cheesecake Factory locations, this one is probably the most disappointing I have visited. \u00a0Since I work nearby, I have dined in 3 or 4 times, each time service has been lacking and food prep time unusually slow. \u00a0My most recent visit, it took us 40 minutes to receive two appetizers without an update from our server that there was any kind of delay. \u00a0I have also done take out orders where the employee is annoyed and short.<br&gt;<br&gt;Food is standard and good, but I think raising the standard of customer service is a big one here.", "rating": 3, "date": "12/28/2019"}, {"text": "They missed the side of mashed potatoes with my entree, but at least they were nice enough to refund me that amount.

Nothing is worse than finding a supposedly vegan option on a menu and finding there is no option for vegan cheese or condiments. I was able to omit the bun and instead have the burger prepared with a lettuce wrap to make it gluten free, and it was AMAZING! My fianc\u00e9 had the regular burger, and said my Impossible burger was better. The fries that accompanied the burger also were really crispy and fresh. <br&gt;<br&gt;The thing that would have made our experience even better would have been a gluten free beer option.

She seemed nice at first but kept pressuring us to order. She had a very quiet voice and would become upset when we would ask her to repeat herself. I tried to ask about and item on the menu but she was very rude about it. I asked her what &amp;#34;white chicken chili&amp;#34; was and she said &amp;#34;what have you never seen chili before. It&amp;#39;s the same thing. Do you know what chicken is? Are you gonna order it or what?&amp;#34; I decided to just order it because she kept making us feel uncomfortable and when she brought the food it looked and tasted like canned dog food... after a couple of bites, I set the plate aside which she had no problem picking it up and charging it instead of asking how it was or if I even liked it. Overall it was a very uncomfortable experience and as great as Charles is, we will no longer be coming back to this location.

So many cheese steaks are either bland or so overloaded that you don&amp;#39;t really taste any distinct flavor... just a big mash up of food overstuffed in a roll that all spills out as you try to eat it.

The cheese perfectly molded everything together so nothing falls out as you eat it.

I initially dined at the bar and there was a man named John who provided terrible service. His critical thinking skills are beyond subpar and he is a terrible liar. When I first sat down he seemed rather attentive acting with urgency to make certain the counter space in front of me was clean and thoroughly wiped down (that was nice). I ordered some sourdough bread and he asked if I&amp;#39;d cared for anything else at the moment. I told him that I wasn&amp;#39;t feeling well, but would like to order something for carry-out in a few moments. It all went downhill thereafter. <br&gt;<br&gt; \u00a0Firstly, all of the utensils provided to me were dirty (I should have taken photos). In all honesty, I get it considering I too have worked in the culinary field so sometimes it happens. But what truly bothered me was the fact that even several moments after my mashed potatoes arrived John hadn&amp;#39;t noticed I set all of the dirty utensils far in front me on a dirty side plate along with a balled-up (clearly already utilized) bed napkin (you can check the video footage to confirm). I finally gave up and asked for a another fork, to which he did retrieve, however he did so in the middle of washing a glass and handed me the fork while his hand was dripping wet (ewww). AND he still didn&amp;#39;t remove any of the dirty utensils which were placed in front of me--even after I succinctly told him they were dirty. <br&gt;<br&gt; \u00a0Again, I was not feeling well and by this point I just wanted to enjoy my mashed potatoes before they got any colder. A few minutes later I was ready to place my To-Go order. I ordered Fried Macaroni Balls for my younger sister and a small side of steamed vegetables with marinara sauce for myself. John asked me how much of a portion I would like and I re-emphasized just a small order of steamed vegetables with only enough sauce to mix them with--NOT a hefty side. Several minutes later I was given a box of reddish-orange sauce which was freezing cold and (what I thought) was my side of steamed vegetables with marinara sauce and no macaroni balls. He (John) had no idea of what the sauce was as he attempted to tell me it was the marinara sauce for my vegetables (this was the first attempted lie). I informed him that I did not need an entire container of marinara sauce; only enough to make my requested vegetables. Just then, it dawned upon John that the cold sauce was for the macaroni balls and he immediately sprung to the kitchen to make certain that they were almost ready. Upon his return, (terribly confused) I informed him that the sauce was freezing cold to which he replied &amp;#34;Oh, you plan on eating it now? They probably thought you were going to eat it later which is why they didn&amp;#39;t heat it up.&amp;#34; (This was his second attempt at a lie.) Surprisingly, he then took the box and went to heat it up. By this point I was entirely fed up, but I didn&amp;#39;t see the point in discussing anything further with John considering how oblivious he was. He brought the remainder of my items and a bag on the side. I bagged up my own items and closed out my tab. I even tipped John--STILL (I know... I know...

Throughout this whole process it was NEVER mentioned that it was an upcharge nor was it listed in the menu to sub in the mac n cheese.

The manager then decides to stand here and argue with my boyfriend for 2 minutes in the middle of the restaurant about a $3 charge. He was VERY rude and talked down to both me and my boyfriend, I have never been so embarrassed in a restaurant before.

Decided to try them again, I got to go food today, two plates and a side was 44$!!!! We got the food, went home and noticed my side was missing! It&amp;#39;s not a big deal to me, I know people make mistakes and things happen. We called right away to let them know and the manager told us the side would be taken off our tab. I ordered a teriyaki chicken with rice and I only ate my rice because the chicken just felt so slimy and gross. It didn&amp;#39;t taste like it had been grilled at all. Almost like they got a piece of rotisserie chicken and put sauce on the top. The skin wasn&amp;#39;t cooked all the way through and it was just wet and gross.

It will give you a little yellow token that you can validate when you are leaving and will save you the hassle of trying to find a spot in this busy location. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now for the restaurant! This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to and the only Cheesecake Factory location I really like. The atmosphere is very lively sometimes noisy and most workers are very friendly and helpful. The lighting is rather dim in certain seating locations. I would say it is &amp;#34;too romantic&amp;#34; when it comes to the lighting if that was a lighting setting. <br&gt;<br&gt;Almost all of the servers I have had in the past were great with timing, knowledge of the vast menu, friendliness and attention to your needs. The food is always great and I have never regretted my decision when ordering. The Red Sangria and Moscow Mules were perfect for drink choices. I even ordered an A.M.F. (a dangerously blue heavier alcoholic drink. Those who know understand) which was not even on the drink menu. I was surprised on how accommodating this location was. They even bring an extra plate if you are sharing a dish and have split it up before. I recommend the Shrimp Bistro Pasta or Chicken Madeira for a main entree and the Portabella, Avocado and Zucchini Fries for an appetizer. Those are just my go to choices. <br&gt;<br&gt;The only problem, as with every other Cheesecake Factory or Man vs. Food competition, is trying to reach that last bite and in this scenario it&amp;#39;s the cheesecake. This cheesecake is probably more total calories than all the food leading up to it and it&amp;#39;s worth it.

The servers are extremely attentive, efficient, quick, and bend over backwards to make sure you are happy and get what you want. They know the menu front to back which is quite impressive considering it is about 20 pages long. The most difficult thing about eating at The Cheesecake Factory is figuring out what you want to eat. The menu is HUGE, and offers everything; pastas, steaks, gourmet chicken dishes, seafood, salads, burgers, sandwiches, wings, quesadillas, and even breakfast. You name it, most likely they have it! You would think with such a large menu the food would be mediocre, but on the contrary it is actually delicious. I have never had a bad meal here or been disappointed with a dish. They even bring out warm bread and butter to get you started.

I&amp;#39;ve tried cauliflower in so many different ways throughout the years and this definitely makes my top 3 list! Absolutely dee-lish!

My server was busy taking an order at a different table so not really her fault. The pork chop dish my partner got was really great, my veggie burger was ok as were the fries.

I love most of their dishes, the feature they have is having varied menu. It is a place where most people can find their favorite food. Also, if you have children, you will not suffer to find tasty and healthy food for them. They have American, Italian, Asian, and global dishes which let you vary your table, and if you are confused which restaurant you want, cheesecake factory is a good choice that gives you many options. Their tasty dishes are a lot, but I love their pastas. It is well flavored and with balanced sauce. I like chipotle pasta and it is spicy if you like spicy and chicken pasta, I recommend it. Cajun Jambalaya is very good as well. It comes with shrimp and chicken, and it cooked with pepper, onion and tomato sauce. It is supper yummy. I like Their popular appetizer cheese macaroni balls, and I cannot go there with no order it, and I tried their lemon grilled salmon. It is so good. <br&gt;However, some of dishes are not delicious at all because they use some strong flavors on it. Especially if they make Asian food. It seems not real Asian food, they overdo it. One time, I ordered fried orang chicken with white rice and it is Asian dish, I couldn&amp;#39;t eat it. It was very sweet and with unnecessary added sauce. Also, my husband ordered Thai chicken dish, and it was over sweet too, so we could not taste the chicken.<br&gt;<br&gt;The prices are expensive, and how expensive? that depends on your order. It is like most of dining restaurants that have two dollars in yelp. If you order expensive food like steak, salmon or so on, it is going to be more expensive. The good thing is their plate is big and you can share it with others, so you and who you are share with, will not need to order more than main plates and that make the total not that expensive. Furthermore, I like going there with my friends, and we enjoy their food. It is recommended place if you have your family or your friends with you. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;The service is good until it become very crowded. The thing that I like is they are friendly and helpful if you have kids and that what I like most in the restaurant. They care about your table to be suitable if you have stroller, and they are in general fast and helpful. However, I said before if it crowded, they become very slow and with untrained service. One time, I waited my order for more than 30 minutes, and they brought the appetizer after the main plate, and they gave us the wrong check, so I didn&amp;#39;t give the waiter tip because I wasn&amp;#39;t satisfied about the service, and it was horrible service.

The sweet brown and regular white bread as amazing. The brown bread wasn&amp;#39;t too sweet so i was able to still enjoy it. The bread was also brought out nice and hot so the butter was able to melt perfectly on the bread before I ate it. The white bread was simple but somehow even taster than the brown bread. For my main course I ordered the BBQ Burger medium rare which perfectly melted into my mouth. The onion straws were the perfect level of crunchy which allowed each bite of my burger to be soft yet crunchy which really sets the burgers apart from your average fast food burger. The BBQ and ranch Sauce mixture on the burger gave the burger a sweet yet refreshing taste. The fries were nice and hot and had the perfect balance of salt. Overall the food was 10/10 in my opinion. <br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Atmosphere and Service was fancy yet casual from the start. When i walked in everyone was nicely dressed and I was greeted by very kind words from the host stand. I had to wait about 5 minutes for the rest of my group of 5 to show up so I got the chance to walk around and check out the huge variety of cheesecake. The whole place gave of a professional yet causal appeal. The lighting at my table was a little darker than I would expect but the booth was very comfortable. My server was a taller man who was very kind and helpful from the start. He brought refills constantly and always checked up on my table to make sure we were okay. He gave very good advice on which type of food to get and even gave his personal favorite foods from the restaurant which was a great help to my friends who were undecided on what to get. His appearance was very professional and acted professional the whole dinning experience. The only thing I wish he did was say his name so I could thank him for his service on this yelp review. My server was also great at pre busing and was very quick to bring me and my friends sides of ranch and to go boxes. \u00a0<br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Overall I paid 30 bucks plus tip for a great time with amazing food and some of the best service I&amp;#39;ve ever had in my life.

The cheesecake is the one item where you cannot go wrong.

My mom got a turkey burger that was incredibly greasy and she was not happy with it. She asked the waiter if he was sure if it was a turkey burger and he assured her it was but again, did not get her something else or offer to take it off of the bill.

And in my opinion, the Cheesecake Factory embodies everything I hate about chain restaurants. <br&gt;<br&gt;Right off the bat, our server was rude and disinterested. And every time he visited the table next to us, he stood between their table and ours, with his behind right in our faces. He was incredibly slow in delivering drinks (we only ordered iced tea) and only came by to refill once. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the Evelyn&amp;#39;s Favorite pasta which was surprisingly one of the few vegetarian items on the menu (aside from salads). My only request was to take off the Kalamata olives. Of course, when the food was delivered, it was chock-full of olives. So not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with, but the small amount of flavor that I was able to detect was ruined by the olives. I&amp;#39;m not a complainer, and I hate sending food back, so I picked as many out as I could, but it wasn&amp;#39;t really worth salvaging. I mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate, took a few bites, and pushed it aside, which is disappointing since it&amp;#39;s a $13 bowl of pasta. <br&gt;<br&gt;When the bill finally arrived, it added up to just under $50 for two iced teas, one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad. I&amp;#39;m sorry, but that price is just absolutely exorbitant for the poor service and lack luster food. This visit was most definitely my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory.

The server acted thoroughly annoyed by our group, was short with us, refused to smile AT ALL, and generally was a complete wench. Splitting the tab was clearly WAY too much work for her, as it took 20 minutes for her to figure out who ordered what (even though we asked if it was ok to split tabs long before we ordered) but actually running the tabs? Wow, add on another 10 minutes! We apologized again for having to split tabs, hoping maybe that would make her less huffy, but she never acknowledged that we were trying to be nice, and instead just went around acting huffy and like we were thorns in her side. <br&gt;<br&gt;Well, obviously she could be a total b*tch because gratuity was already included. 18% on the tab, which I understand with large groups. However, I felt she was acting as bitchy as she wanted to because in the end, she&amp;#39;d be getting a good tip regardless. <br&gt;<br&gt;As for the food, it&amp;#39;s a big whatever.

I absorbed most of the splatter, in my mouth, left eye, and face. She fortunately was only splashed on her body and hand. Georgina didn&amp;#39;t even say anything to us, but picked up the tray and kept going. After a few moments of waiting, I got up and went to the restroom to clean myself off, since I didn&amp;#39;t even have a place setting or napkin at the table. On the way back, I stopped and asked to speak with a manager. A young man with curly hair, and square framed glasses was brought to me and didn&amp;#39;t give me his name. I told him our situation, and what had happened. I told him I could not only smell, but also taste the cleaning solution that had been on the rag and tray. At first I asked if it was bleach based, and he assured me it wasn&amp;#39;t. Then he said he&amp;#39;d talk to our server, and left things at that by turning around to talk to the hostesses. Clearly, I was dismissed. So I returned to the table, disgusted, upset, and smelling of cleaning solution. My appetite was ruined at this point, so I choose not to order anything. Having chemicals splashed into your mouth, even a few droplets, will do that to a person. At this point, our friend STILL hadn&amp;#39;t received his iced tea.

At this point, my left eye was feeling irritated, and I went to flush it out in the men&amp;#39;s room with water as best I could. When I returned to the table, our orders were just coming out. And my roommates order was wrong. He had ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp, and NO asparagus. And he got asparagus mixed into all his noodles. At this point, he notified the food runner who had brought his dish that it was wrong. The young man said sorry, and then walked away without offering to replace or fix the order. he decided to just pick out the asparagus, and deal with it since he was hungry, and didn&amp;#39;t feel like waiting another 30 minutes. At this point, Georgina has appeared at our table 4 times total. While refilling glassing, she is reaching directly in front of my roommates mothers face, my face, and our friend seated on the other side of the booth. No excuse me, no words at all, and STILL no apology from her for the splashing. While my friends ate, I again went to the restroom to flush my eye. I again stopped to speak with the manager from earlier, and asked him for the name of the chemical used for cleaning. He immediately told me that &amp;#34;I already told you sir that we do not use bleach products here.&amp;#34; He furthermore told me that he had spoken to our server, and she said she didn&amp;#39;t have any cleaning solution or rags with her when she dropped her tray.

He informed me that they didn&amp;#39;t use chemicals for cleaning, and then said they used a sanitation solution. I&amp;#39;m sorry, but that would be a chemical. I pointed that out, and told him I was very upset with how this had all been handled. I made it clear again, that I wasn&amp;#39;t looking for anything from him, except the name of the chemical. He asked if there was anything he could do to make my evening better, covering my meal or anything. I once more told him that I had chosen NOT to eat, after getting splashed and having that rancid taste of chemicals in my mouth. He then said he would get me the name of the solution used, after my having exhausted every other avenue, and telling him I would be contacting the corporate office. At this point, I told him I was done with the conversation, and wanted nothing more to do with him, as he clearly didn&amp;#39;t care about the situation.
