This wasn&amp;#39;t the case. \u00a0We were informed it would be a 15 minute wait, and to be honest, I wasn&amp;#39;t in the mood for that, and was ready to go anywhere else in the mall- \u00a0My date insisted, and my crabby-butt begrudgingly agreed, throwing shade.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;d basically decided on a burger, before we were even seated, because it&amp;#39;s something you typically can&amp;#39;t screw up at a place like this. \u00a0My date talked about the burrito, and I warned them it was a bad decision, but they were *all about* it, and said they&amp;#39;d enjoyed it in the past. \u00a0Did I mention I had a bad feeling about this place, and didn&amp;#39;t want to go here? ;-)<br&gt;When my food arrived (just mine) I tried some fries. \u00a0They weren&amp;#39;t cold, but they tasted like they&amp;#39;d been sitting in an oven? \u00a0Or like they&amp;#39;d been toasting under a warmer. \u00a0Ugh. \u00a0This pissed me off. \u00a0The Cheesecake factory isn&amp;#39;t cheap. \u00a0When you charge a certain amount of money for your entrees, and there&amp;#39;s always a wait for a table, you don&amp;#39;t DO STUFF like this. \u00a0The burger: cooked to a nice medium rare, but the bun was soggy, the lettuce was wilted to the point of tissue paper, and it was obvious it&amp;#39;d been sitting. Oh well?<br&gt;<br&gt;When my date&amp;#39;s food arrived, they asked if I&amp;#39;d like to try some: \u00a0Sure. \u00a0They cut it open, and as you&amp;#39;ll see in the pics, we found a rice burrito, with a few pieces of chicken meat inside. \u00a0This ruined the rest of my mood for the night. \u00a0I&amp;#39;ll repeat myself: \u00a0When you charge a certain amount of money for your entrees, you can&amp;#39;t get away with this. \u00a0Maybe they had new cooks? \u00a0Maybe they were running out of proteins and rationing them? Maybe this is just the signs of a chain on the decline. \u00a0Either way, it&amp;#39;s inexcusable. \u00a0When we flat-out asked them to take the burrito off the bill, the manager seemed put-off by the request; \u00a0No, we *picked* the chicken out of it, dude! \u00a0Ugh.<br&gt;<br&gt;The wait staff were decent, that&amp;#39;s what the stars are for, but I won&amp;#39;t come back. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;What happened to this place?", "rating": 2, "date": "7/20/2019"}, {"text": "It was amazing!

They continuously bring our cold or burnt foods and when you complain one server had the audacity to say &amp;#34;there&amp;#39;s no way your food could be cold&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;what do you want me to do&amp;#34;. That&amp;#39;s not acceptable behavior that&amp;#39;s actually so disrespectful. I&amp;#39;m a person of color so service people give me a hard time everywhere I go, getting great service is a once in a lifetime thing for people like me. I usually allow it but this Cheesecake Factory is the worst service ever consistently how is that even possible. It&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re being trained to be rude and unhelpful towards the huge Somali community that come to this location. The management seems really nice and helpful, the bussers are really great, but the servers need some training because they&amp;#39;re unconscious biases are constantly on display. I do not see myself coming back to this location ever again.

Both my wife and I ordered off it and the meals were very tasty and satisfying. I had lemon garlic shrimp and she had the chicken salad. My boys ordered off the regular menu with steak medallions and chicken tacos and they were well seasoned and tasty. The Oreo and Godiva cheesecakes were of course rich and decadent.

Yes, I understand its just water, no big deal, but I think an apology would suffice and would&amp;#39;ve been appropriate. What else was disappointing was that I ordered the chicken Bellagio and had received a plate of undercooked spaghetti noodles which then took at least 10 minutes to flag down our waitress to get a new plate.

Waiting 5 more minutes my food still didn&amp;#39;t arrive and nor did our waitress come to make sure everything was ok.

It was clear that I had an empty place in front of me and I had not received my food but she went to the other side of the table with the people who were eating to ask if they were ok.

However, my last experience, made me see life through Gordon Ramsey&amp;#39;s eyes. <br&gt;<br&gt;The first thing I will say is that the avocado egg rolls were amazing. So excellent job. Most appetizers I&amp;#39;ve had here have been great. <br&gt;<br&gt;Yet, unfortunately the main course was anything but. I&amp;#39;ll keep it short in saying we ordered our daughter buttered noodles, a nice simple meal as long as it doesn&amp;#39;t sit under a heat lamp for too long. By our estimates, the buttered noodles were under a heat lamp for at least 20 minutes. The end result is severally brown, and hard noodles, you can&amp;#39;t put a fork in. I am not joking when I say this. Even the person helping our server looked at the dish when they were putting it on the table, paused before putting it down, looked curiously at the dish and then layed it in front of our 2-year-old. A piping hot plate, and dried food. <br&gt;<br&gt;I thought maybe it would have ended there, but by order of enchiladas were dried too, the sauce was entirely baked into the tortilla meaning: no sauce. The beans had a cooked layer of dryness, and the cilantro rice was so baked on the top layer, I could practically remove the entire layer as it&amp;#39;s own cover. I tried one, bite, but it was hard and I couldn&amp;#39;t finish it. <br&gt;<br&gt;My son said his spicy chicken sandwich was okay, except that the spice was inconsistent. One part of the chicken had almost no spice and the other was way too hot for him to eat. While this is an opinion of his, I would agree with him that there shouldn&amp;#39;t be so much disparity on a single piece of chicken. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our server was friendly when she took our orders, but never brought the bread she said she was going to bring, and only showed up once after we received our order. That was to give us a check. When she asked if I wanted a box for the pasta we didn&amp;#39;t eat, she looked down at the bowl, and said, &amp;#34;Oh. Probably not.&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;I thought about saying something to management, but frankly I&amp;#39;ve had similar experiences, and was just tired of saying anything. <br&gt;<br&gt;The cheesecake was of course very good. <br&gt;<br&gt;End result of my many experiences here: Appetizers are always amazing, service can be great, or shoddy depending on the server, main entrees are wildly inconsistent. Cheesecake is always very good. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, the inconsistency is very difficult as I don&amp;#39;t know if I am going to have a nice meal, or a bad experience.

Only if your goal is to flame the culinary vanity of a mundane crowd.<br&gt;<br&gt;It seemed like mere minutes after I ordered when the food arrived. Apparently in America, you&amp;#39;re not supposed to order slow, and have a relaxed multi-hour dinner with camaraderie.

There is no noble goal to skirmish with the ignorance of it&amp;#39;s customers, but further raises the curtain.

We had been told there would be a 15-20 minute wait. We were standing around (all seats/benches occupied with other wanna-be diners) for about 5 minutes when the pager went off. Excited that the wait was shorter, I showed others in our party and turned around to the host stand. Some host/manager guy said, hey, it&amp;#39;s going to be about 15-20 minutes. I didn&amp;#39;t know how to process the information, so I just said, &amp;#34;um, yeah, you already told us that.&amp;#34; I thought about it and the people behind me that thought we were going to sit down and said, &amp;#34;really, you paged me over here to tell me that? I thought our table was ready.&amp;#34; If it was a huge change in wait, I could see that, but it was more just odd.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food was mostly well-prepared, but the service was uneven.

There was about 5-10 minutes between the first plate and the last plate getting laid down. And no, no one ordered anything unusual or wanted special modifications. It was a weird night service-wise. The server was very personable and attentive at the table, but it took a while for drinks and bread, then we&amp;#39;d have these gaps of time where we wouldn&amp;#39;t see him for a while.<br&gt;<br&gt;Their drink menu has a section of martinis - but none of the drinks on it are martinis, they&amp;#39;re just these weird made-up sugary concoctions of bizarre flavor combinations. There was - honest to God - not a single martini on the page. I had to manually order a martini, specify an actual gin, and ask for olives. Sheesh! And it basically sucked. I hate that word, but it fits in this case. Made me feel like a idiot even ordering it. Oh well.<br&gt;<br&gt;Oh well, and about the menus, this is rich. These guys are so hard up for money, that they actually put ads for other stuff inside their menu. Not some food tie-in, just other stores at the mall (Southdale). So while I&amp;#39;m looking over the ridiculous non-martini Martini section, on the opposite page, I have some model leering at me with tacky-looking jewelry from some store in the mall. Ha!<br&gt;<br&gt;Another pet peeve - I ordered one of their burgers with fries. The fries came in a little metal bucket with a paper liner. The fries were just luke warm. Everyone that wanted to try one did what I did - ate 1-2, then no more. They&amp;#39;re just gross when they&amp;#39;re not hot. Oh, and if you&amp;#39;re serving a burger with fries, you bring ketchup. Don&amp;#39;t make me ask for it. That&amp;#39;s another few minutes of waiting right there. They didn&amp;#39;t even bring a bottle, just a little dressing bowl with a dollop of ketchup in it. Boo!<br&gt;<br&gt;Okay, soapbox mode off, but it was a strange dining experience.

We requested crispy bacon again and the waitress attempted to take my 4 year olds entire plate of pancakes back to the kitchen, just to get crispy bacon. The distraught look on his face was all she needed to sit the plate back down and she said she would just bring a side of bacon. So, she shows up about 1 minute later with some COLD crispy bacon. I imagine this was pre cooked bacon used to top salads and/or soups, because it obviously wasn&amp;#39;t cooked that fast.

Our appetizers not only took this long, but came one by one! Our first appetizer (the avocado egg rolls) was brought by a man who, after hearing about how long we waited, rudely responded by saying &amp;#34;do you want it or not&amp;#34;. Our appetizers soon followed after 2 hours dedicated all to this restaurant. Oh yeah, the food! The two tables sitting next to us all received their food even after coming at least twenty minutes after us. One of our family members had to leave because he had to work!!! Our food came and it was fine, but at this point, we lost our appetite honestly. The manger, Jennifer, was INCREDIBLY RUDE. She took two appetizers off out of an order from a group of seven people and made far too many rude comments. She said that she would take care of the food of my family member, but we didn&amp;#39;t realize she would take it off completely! When we asked to order it, she said that she would have to charge us. Really?!? He left because we had waited far more than an hour, and know we have to pay?! At this point, we were livid and wished to speak to the general manager. As Jennifer left, she said that she had been here for 12 years and was experienced for the job. She has been here for 12 years; that doesn&amp;#39;t mean they were good years! Absolutely horrible. Anyway, in short, the general manager came, but none of the &amp;#34;reductions&amp;#34; could fix this horrible experience.

The special sauce really isn&amp;#39;t a sauce, but more like some random ingredients pureed to a disgusting blob on the bottom of my burger.

First warning sign: It&amp;#39;s about 20 pages long. If the menu is unfocused, the kitchen is unfocused.

The edamame appetizer ($4.95) is perfectly steamed and salted, and a good portion of pods. The avocado eggrolls ($9.95) are delicious and decadent with chunks of avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion and cilantro in a crisp wrapper with a tamarind-cashew dipping sauce. If you eat shrimp, the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls ($8.95) are as good as those I&amp;#39;ve had in any authentic Asian restaurant. Also offered is guacamole made-to-order, sweet corn tamale cakes and a fire roasted artichoke with dipping sauce.<br&gt;<br&gt;The appetizer salads are abundant, colorful, fresh and easily a meal by themselves. The tossed green salad ($6.95) is the perfect house salad with tomato wedges, sliced cucumber and julienned beet, zucchini and carrot. I highly recommend the peanut cilantro dressing, but the Asian plum dressing and balsamic vinaigrette are also very good. Also tasty is the French country salad ($8.95) with beets, grilled asparagus and pecans (can hold the goat cheese) and the vegetable chopped salad ($8.95) with edamame, green beans, asparagus, cucumber, tomato, roasted beets and apple in a pomegranate vinaigrette (can hold the white cheddar).<br&gt;<br&gt;Lunch combos and portions are served every day until 5:00 p.m. and range from $7.95 to $10.95. My favorite is the roasted vegetable and goat cheese pizza with Japanese eggplant, artichoke, red and yellow pepper, Kalamata olives and tomato, paired with the tossed green salad. (Vegans, ask them to hold all the cheese on the pizza since there is parmesan in addition to goat cheese.) The Santa Fe entr\u00e9e salad is simple southwestern goodness with greens, corn, black beans, tomato and tortilla strips in the spicy peanut-cilantro dressing ($9.95 for lunch portion; $13.95 for entr\u00e9e size). You can hold the chicken and cheese and add avocado.<br&gt;<br&gt;The grilled portabella on a bun ($10.95) is a huge mushroom cap flavored with herbs topped with lettuce, tomato and grilled red onion (can add avocado and hold the cheese and the spicy mayo) served with fries, or they happily substitute any side. The incredible grilled eggplant sandwich is also great - again, I recommend adding avocado if you hold the cheese and mayo. A number of nice vegetable sides are available including broccoli, corn succotash, asparagus, saut\u00e9ed spinach and snow peas with veggies, ranging from $3.95 to $6.50.<br&gt;<br&gt;Vegetarians can choose from more than 25 flavors of cheesecake and numerous other stunning desserts.

The floors are white marble, the booths and tables are constructed of some sort of dark wood, and the lighting is a bit brighter than dim which helps make this place seem more classy.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the Chicken Marsala which was served on a bed of bow tie pasta and one stray tube of penne pasta. Chicken Marsala is typically one of my favorite Itallian dishes as it offers the perfect balance of sweet and salty with the nice Marsala wine flavor. The portion that came was fairly large and came with a good amount of chicken and mushrooms and a nice brown gravy. If presentation were the only catagory I was judging this place on they would have certainly earned at least one additional star. After the first few bites I noticed that the chicken did not really have any flavor itself, and the Marsala sauce resting on the chicken was the only thing giving the dish any life at all. This immediately made me think of a large metal tin resting gently on a tub of hot water, in the kitchen, piled high with chicken breasts and &amp;#34;chefs&amp;#34; pulling from this pile, throwing them onto a bed of (insert pasta type here) then going over to the sauce bin, slathering the plate with (insert sauce type here), right before being served. More or less your high end production assembly line type of food service (for clarification: high end for this catagory is at best 3 stars). The Marsala sauce had nice initial flavor, unfortunately the back end tasted a bit watered down. I don&amp;#39;t like wasting food, so I finished the chicken and mushrooms, but the pasta and watery sauce was too much for me to be able to put it down.<br&gt;<br&gt;Being that we were at the Cheesecake Factory and that I love Cheesecake, this made for a very nice arrangement! If you are an avid Cheesecake lover such as myself they basically have every variety of cheesecake you would ever want. Fruit toppings, chocolate toppings, candy bar toppings, Orea toppings, combinations thereof, the list is endless and one should literally decide by throwing a dart into a board. We ended up with the Snickers Cheesecake and it was delicious! Had we just come here for dessert, easily 4 stars. It tasted like the whip cream was made in-house; it was nice and cold, thick, and paired very nicely with our cheesecake, and I can easily see it pairing well with fruit topped cheesecakes as well.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall the experience was enjoyable, I just wish the food tasted better (especially for the price), and that the server came around a bit more frequently.
