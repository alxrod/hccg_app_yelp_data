We put in the mini corn dogs for my 2 year old before anything else. The menu is huuuuge! It&amp;#39;s a lot to look at so it took us a while to decide. When my son&amp;#39;s food came we ordered our meals. <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered the calamari which was so delicious. Very tender and not tough at all. The breading was the perfect texture, not too hard. I got the pasta carbonara and I forget the exact name of my husband&amp;#39;s dish, but it was breaded chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus. My pasta was creamy and flavorful. They could&amp;#39;ve gone a little lighter on the pepper but I loved it anyway. My husband&amp;#39;s chicken was really yummy. The breading was very light and crisp. We also got a side of Mac n cheese and it&amp;#39;s so good! <br&gt;<br&gt;The portions are very decent, so we took the rest of our meals to go. We also ordered two slice of cheesecake to go - the banana cream and Oreo. Those things got devoured so fast when we got home that I didn&amp;#39;t even have time to take a picture lol.

Even the table next to us had both breads. We had pork belly sliders which were hot and delicious. I believe it had a sweet barbecue sauce. We also had the filet mignon which was standard and the evelyns favorite pasta that was recommended by the waitress. There was a problem with my tuna poke dish for some reason. It had to come a little later than the other dishes. So it took like 35 minutes after the appetizer (sliders) came. I believe it was a manager who came to apologize to us and explain that I will get a free salad or soup to make up for the wait.

He might of been busy as the restaurant was pretty packed. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos. (220 calories) He ordered french fries. We then waited for a while and I heard another table across from us say to another waiter that the food that was just placed on their table want theirs. That server left the food on their table and called over our waiter to let him know the food was delivered to them instead of our table. Our waiter then picked our food up from their table and walked into the kitchen with our food. About 5 minutes later comes out with the same plates and dropped them off to us. \u00a0I asked him if the other table touched the food and he got a little flustered and said no they didn&amp;#39;t and apologized. <br&gt;<br&gt;So we were given food that was dropped off at another table. I saw the manager near us so I called him over, explained the situation and asked him for a condiment. I wasn&amp;#39;t looking for anything free I told him. I was just annoyed that this situation had happened. <br&gt;<br&gt;After I ate my tacos (that were given to another table by mistake) I wanted a slice of cheesecake being that we were in the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered a slice called Andy&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple. (1280 calories!!) It was worth every single calorie. <br&gt;<br&gt;Very long review short (sorry about that), while I loved the food, I will not be going back to the CCF as I think the situation could of been handled better. If anything the manager could of had the food be remade.

But here specially this one they have them bring the food to the table, and extra other bs. You would think that your waiter/waitress is cooking your food too! with how long it takes them to come back to your table. there should be at least other servers being out the food so that they can have the time to check in with us to see if we need anything else, or take our orders. especially when it&amp;#39;s busy they shouldn&amp;#39;t have to do all the work.

It&amp;#39;s a restaurant attached to Queens Center Mall and while the traffic when this location first opened was ridiculous (I&amp;#39;m talking waiting time for HOURS), the wait doesn&amp;#39;t seem very long now. I came here to have dinner on Sunday night and was shocked at how small the place was! I mean.. it was definitely the smallest Cheesecake Factory I&amp;#39;ve ever been to. We wanted a booth so the wait was around 20 minutes, though I definitely felt like we waited longer than that. High seats were available immediately and that section was largely empty. There&amp;#39;s a small couch outside that constitutes as a waiting area, but otherwise everyone just stands around with their little beeper waiting to be called up.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our waitress was friendly but she wasn&amp;#39;t very attentive. She did come to refill our waters every now and then but we mostly had to call her over. She told us an appetizer would take 4 additional minutes to come out but we waited about 15 until another waitress brought it over and apologized. People come to celebrate their birthdays often, I believe you get a complimentary slice of cheesecake when you celebrate here.. but you&amp;#39;ll hear them singing that quite often. They weren&amp;#39;t very cheerful about it and seemed tired/unhappy. It definitely does not make you feel very special.<br&gt;<br&gt;I recommend the avocado eggrolls (these are amazing!!) and the crab artichoke dip. The salmon firecrackers were also pretty good. I enjoy the appetizers here a lot, and two appetizers is as filling as an entree for me! My friend got a hibachi steak and asked for it medium rare but it definitely came out well done. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, the food here is pretty good and the portions are EXTREMELY HUGE making the food here relatively affordable, however when I think of the Cheesecake Factory I imagine(d) a better experience than I had here.

Come early!<br&gt;<br&gt;My go-to dish here is the Shrimp with Angel Hair pasta dish. I always get it off the regular menu and you bet it is a huge portion! Angel Hair with large shrimp, garlic, lemon, herbs, and diced tomato. Although the dish I had today was a tad dry, the combination of flavors made it so delicious! <br&gt;<br&gt;Fried Mac &amp;amp; Cheese. Four giant balls of mac and cheese inside of a crispy deep fried layer with marinara sauce then topped with cheese. They arrived to my table piping hot! So good! A nice starter for the table. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;Oreo Extreme Dream Cheesecake. Oh yes baby, come home with me! Layers of fudge cake, oreo, and chocolate mousse. This is so heavenly delicious that you will dream about it for days to come! GET THIS! <br&gt;<br&gt;Arnold Palmer. Lemonade and iced tea mix. Always a great drink to get!

After the hour we come back and we&amp;#39;re given a pager. When it vibrates that means a table is ready. We waited over an hour and half! We finally get a table and it was so hectic. The servers were all over the place. My friend got the wrong dish and had to wait over 45 mins to get her correct dish. Apparently that qualifies for a discounted price or a free dish??????

At one point one of the 10 waiters I had asked if I wanted bread? Yes after 30 mins of nothing we&amp;#39;d like some bread. The pasta wasn&amp;#39;t spicy. Creamy and mild.

I always said when I die sprinkle my ashes over Cheesecake Factory. I changed my mind. I decided on a Green Burial instead. I&amp;#39;m digressing! <br&gt;<br&gt;First: Going to Sunday Brunch was on our bucket list for years. I&amp;#39;m certainly glad they decided to offer it on Saturday too. Not that a weekend trip either day to this mall is enjoyable. The train ride is always over an hour these days. That being said, my daughter is happy she can have the brunch menu at Lunchtime. I&amp;#39;ll stick with the lunch menu. Brunch is 10-2 Saturday and Sunday now. <br&gt;<br&gt;Second: Service has greatly improved. We were greeted at the reception by a lovely young lady with a beautiful smile on her face. After quickly being escorted to our table, within minutes our server was at our ready. She also was lovely and smiling in addition to friendly. I finally felt welcome and at home at this location like I had at other locations! I think they finally got the CCF vibe down on their customer service!<br&gt;<br&gt;Third: Food preparation was timely. The food came out hot and portions are huge as always. I am always on the hunt for a decent pancake. Forget CCF on that one. I really wolfed them down. Some bites were light and fluffy while others were thick and heavy. I didn&amp;#39;t know it was poor blending of the Ricotta into the batter until my Yelp Friend told me. Oh well. I&amp;#39;m not lowering my stars this review because I was the one that made poor food and drink choices this visit! \u00a0I&amp;#39;ll know better next time! My daughter was really pleased with her meal. Naturally she had enough to take half home. She has self control that I lack!! She had Chicken and Waffles. She said the Chicken and the Waffles has a very nice taste. The potatoes were just the way she likes them. Drinks rated poor on my daughter&amp;#39;s side. She didn&amp;#39;t like her ice tea. She said it was weak. I made another poor choice. I had a Strawberry Smoothie. I thought I had gotten it before. I may have had a Strawberry Frozen Daiquiri without liquor. This smoothie was more like having desert. Very filling. I couldn&amp;#39;t get cheesecake after that. I wasn&amp;#39;t in the mood to take it home. Maybe if my daughter had split her piece. Fat chance! <br&gt;<br&gt;Finally: They do have good perks some times. We had a coupon from our last visit good for a free piece of cheesecake when you spend $30. My daughter wanted to try what I had last visit. She got Coffee and Cream Chocolate Supreme to go. With her will power she&amp;#39;ll eat it a little every day all week. I need to learn to be that good! <br&gt;Conclusion and recommendations: They are getting their act together at this CCF location. The food preparation is still hit or miss. I&amp;#39;ve missed out two out of three meals so far. Remember my burnt Cuban Sandwich? I&amp;#39;m going to keep going. Maybe no more frequently than once a month. Preferably on a weekday for lunch! <br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re as big a fan of their cheesecake as I am, you will enjoy. I&amp;#39;m really there for the cheesecake! <br&gt;And a word of warning: Don&amp;#39;t look at the calories on the different cheesecake flavors.

Just my luck and what I get for being lazy &amp;amp; settling for the closest place to eat. \u00a0But since I&amp;#39;ve been to several Cheesecake factories, I didn&amp;#39;t think it would be bad.

OH my freaking goodness! It was cold and my steak was purple!!! I asked for it medium. I specifically told her I want it pink inside. The mushrooms and onions were a joke. \u00a0I had a huge piece of onion skin in my dish. The mashed potatoes were cold, with huge chunks of grey potatoes, so cold that the butter they put on top would barely melt &amp;amp; wasabi??? What wasabi?? There wasn&amp;#39;t even a hint. \u00a0My asparagus was cut into little pieces. \u00a0On to the carbonara, it was super watery.. &amp;amp; I know that when you make pasta you usually have to put it into a sautee pan with some pasta water and sauce to coat the pasta well. \u00a0Obviously they added too much pasta water in the process.<br&gt;<br&gt;Now on to the service. The black girl with the platinum blonde shoulder length curly hair was the waitress who started us out (sorry not to offend anyone, I just forgot her name and if someone from the restaurant reads this I want them to know who she is) she practically dropped the plates of food down onto the table, she never checked on us except right when she walked away after &amp;#34;dropping&amp;#34; our plates off literally 3 seconds later. \u00a0She didn&amp;#39;t refill water, nothing!! \u00a0We then were told by another girl while talking over her back that she was going to be taking over. We never saw her again. Again, it wasn&amp;#39;t that crowded. We had to flag down blonde girl to ask for water and then after another long while flag her down again to ask for the check because the other girl who was supposedly taking over never came to us. Finally blonde girl brings the bag and container and practically dropped it into the carbonara. We then flagged down second girl to take the credit card. I was so disgusted.

The woman at the desk who took our name and gave us our vibrator thingy was efficient and cordial. But the system for seating people is cluttered and inefficient. She took our pager and told us to wait around the other side of the huge column, which is a convergence of people coming to the door to leave and had us feeling like we were in the way.<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s far too loud. My husband and I could not talk without shouting. We&amp;#39;re getting old. We don&amp;#39;t like to shout at one another to have a simple conversation. It&amp;#39;s also way too dim. I almost couldn&amp;#39;t read the menu, which seriously needs to be edited. Cut out 150 items and do the other 100 well.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our waiter, while service was slow, was polite and answered my questions about the Blood Orange Martini. The drink was between $12 and $14...but you only got the drink in the glass. You are not served the shaker with another drink and a half, like you get at Applebee&amp;#39;s for about the same price. So I laughed and did not get anything more than a soda.<br&gt;<br&gt; But we never got water. Do they not bring it automatically? Were we supposed to ask for it?<br&gt;<br&gt;We decided to try the truffle bacon cheese sticks. Basically, it&amp;#39;s a grilled cheese with bacon that is cut into four strips. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell you what the cheese was because it had no flavor. The bacon was the only part of it that did have flavor, though it was toasted nicely. The tomato dipping sauce tasted like straight tomato paste. Not even cooked tomato paste. And it was unseasoned. Tasted like it came directly out of the can with nothing done to it. Some restaurants don&amp;#39;t understand that tomato paste needs to be cooked to get rid of that canned paste flavor. I had one stick out of four and a small taste of the tomato paste.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the Carne Asada Steak Medallions, &amp;#34;Covered with Sauteed Peppers, Onions and Cilantro. Served with Creamy Ranchero Sauce, Fresh Corn and White Rice&amp;#34; the menu says. Well, the peppers and onions need to go another four or five minutes to begin to be called sauteed. They were warmed but largely still crisp and uncooked. I also found a mushroom slice. So it&amp;#39;s a good thing my mother wasn&amp;#39;t with us and didn&amp;#39;t get that plate, because she&amp;#39;s allergic to them. That&amp;#39;s careless prep. <br&gt;<br&gt;My rice was dry as a bone and CRUSTY. The corn was there. It had these salty bits of what I imagine is a queso. The steak itself is underseasoned but the sauce with it had this mysterious heat to it. No real flavor to speak of. Just heat. It went away quickly with a bite of the bread that had been brought at the beginning of the meal.<br&gt;<br&gt;There&amp;#39;s always this quandry when you order steak at a place you&amp;#39;ve never been before. Do I order it medium and hope they go under and I get it rare? Or will they overcook and it comes to me well and I have to send it back? Do I order it rare and maybe they go over to a medium, which I can usually deal with, or will they under and I get it blue? Well, I took the risk. I ordered rare. I got blue.I actually had to get out my phone&amp;#39;s flashlight to see just how blue it was. I should have sent it back, but I do enjoy a well-prepared rare/very rare steak sometimes. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m now regretting NOT sending it back, as supper has not been sitting well ever since (for either of us). From my entire entree plate, I ate the meat, a couple bites of corn, and one single bite of rice. I almost stopped at Burger King on my way home, but my stomach has been so upset I just came home and popped an antacid. I did tell the waiter about the rice when he picked up my plate. He took $4 off the entree, which I do appreciate.<br&gt;<br&gt;My husband ordered the orange chicken. His rice was also bone dry. The vegetables on his plate were barely past warmed, not much cooked. The chicken itself was not a crisp deep fry. The sauce was not spicy, as the menu describes, and there was this odd flavor on the back end of a bite. Like grated, burnt orange peel. It wasn&amp;#39;t very pleasant. Panda Express in the food court does a MUCH better and FAR MORE REASONABLY PRICED orange chicken. They also have much better rice.<br&gt;<br&gt;The table next to us, who had been seated, with alcoholic beverages AND water before us, were brought their entrees after ours, btw, so I hope they weren&amp;#39;t upset about that.<br&gt;<br&gt;A very serious suggestion for the restaurant: Make miniature versions of your desserts and offer a &amp;#34;Flight&amp;#34; of 3 or 5 flavors, so that customers can have a taste of several desserts. I seriously counted 17 different desserts I wanted to try. If I could get a flight of five and my husband could get a flight of five, that&amp;#39;s ten desserts we both could share and try.<br&gt;<br&gt;We settled on the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake. That was seriously the best part of the meal other than the bread at the beginning. The toasted meringue on top was quite tasty. It&amp;#39;s not a sickly sweet lemon, but a nice, tart lemon.

How did leftovers from other dishes get into my dish???<br&gt;Google the term Pagpag, is that what you serve?<br&gt;<br&gt;The 2 stars are for the staff and decor, the Cheesecake factory should be a 5 star place all the way...shame!", "rating": 1, "date": "6/2/2018"}, {"text": "This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory.

The waits were ridiculously long, but we did end up finding seats at the bar after half an hour of stalking the high tops. The service was pretty quick given the amount of people there for opening week. Our bartender always made sure we were taken care of. My only complaint is that the food and cheesecake took FOREVER to come out. I&amp;#39;m sure they were overwhelmed with orders, so I understand, it was just tough because we were all so hungry.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking to get a drink here, get the pineapple moscow mule. It is delicious and has a gigantic slice of fresh pineapple in your drink. For dinner, I had the chicken bellagio (which is my go to dish here) and the tiramisu cheesecake. The chicken bellagio was smaller in portion size than at some of the other Cheesecakes I&amp;#39;ve been to, but the quality is better. It was also decorated very nicely. I really enjoyed the tiramisu cheesecake. It was light an fluffy, but it made me so thirsty afterwards. I had to chug three glasses of water just to feel slightly hydrated.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, had a good experience here. Good company, good food and good drinks!

These days, things have slowed down a bit but the wait times are often still bizarre. <br&gt;<br&gt;So why despite everyone&amp;#39;s love for chain restaurants, do I want to write a review? It actually came down to one instance. While I feel I&amp;#39;ve always had a 3/5 star experience (not just this Cheesecake Factory, but every Cheesecake Factory location), given the long wait time, servers in the past forgetting to bring silverware, coming back to tell me multiple times what I ordered is unavailable, etc, I came here recently ahead of my larger party to put my name down for a table and was told 20 minutes despite the restaurant being pretty empty. My party came in soon after through a different door and didn&amp;#39;t see me already waiting and asked for a table as well and they were seated immediately. (WHAT?!) I don&amp;#39;t understand why I was told to wait by one hostess when another hostess sat the same party immediately.<br&gt;<br&gt;This makes me think that the wait times are often disproportionately exaggerated and you want us to wait just for the sake of waiting.

I don&amp;#39;t know what else to tell you other than it was out of this fucking world. <br&gt;<br&gt;For 4 people, we ended up getting the guacamole egg roll and fried mac and cheese ball appetizers.<br&gt;<br&gt;For entrees:<br&gt;--I got the Steak Diane (delicious sauce and perfectly cooked steak)<br&gt;<br&gt;--Country chicken and biscuits (my girl went nuts over this and she&amp;#39;s still talking about it).<br&gt;<br&gt;--fish tacos for my friend (they were delicious and not fishy at all)<br&gt;<br&gt;--and a bowl of mac and cheese for our friend&amp;#39;s 2 year old son.<br&gt;<br&gt;For desert: The crunchy Nutella cheesecake that we all split (and couldn&amp;#39;t even finish).<br&gt;<br&gt;PROS:<br&gt;-great food.

So just a FYI.<br&gt;<br&gt;- because the place is so new they really want to make a good impression. The problem with this was, we had about (not kidding) 3 people constantly checking in on us. So every few minutes someone else would come up to the table and say &amp;#34;is everything alright?&amp;#34; Then 60 seconds later someone else would say &amp;#34;just checking to make sure everything is alright.&amp;#34; Then a few minutes later someone else would come up to our table and say &amp;#34;just wanna make sure everything is okay.&amp;#34; Every time we told them we were fine.

I would definitely not recommend anyone this restaurant.

It was around 5pm and luckily we got seated after waiting for 20min., which isn&amp;#39;t bad. The food we ordered...<br&gt;<br&gt;1. Pineapple Moscow Mule- really good! Can barely taste the vodka. It was like pineapple juice.<br&gt;<br&gt;2. Fried Mac and Cheese- loved it! Crunchy on the outside and cheesy inside.<br&gt;<br&gt;3. Steak Diane (medium rare)- it was a bit overcooked at some part but it was still pretty good. Mashed Potatoes was pretty good as well.<br&gt;<br&gt;4. Chicken Marsala and Mushroom w. Bowtie Pasta (forgot the name)- more to the sweeter side but still good. <br&gt;<br&gt;5. Southern Fried Catfish- The catfish was really soft, which is great! Mashed potatoes ofc was good. <br&gt;<br&gt;The only thing that I didn&amp;#39;t really like was how slow the service is. It takes a while for them to serve all the food out, so expect that to happen. Either the chefs gotta learn how to cook faster or they gotta hire more chefs. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, the food was pretty good so I didn&amp;#39;t mind about the long wait.

This is one of New York City&amp;#39;s busiest restaurants. There has been many instances where I&amp;#39;ve come into work before we&amp;#39;ve even opened and 10 minutes into our shift we&amp;#39;re busy, possibly on a wait, due to the lack of staff, and the place is a mess. I know matters such as this are hard to predict and is easier said than done when it comes to being managed, however, eventually with great leadership we shouldn&amp;#39;t be repeating the same mistakes.<br&gt;<br&gt;Yet they have been and it&amp;#39;s becoming way to noticeable. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;Corporate, I&amp;#39;m praying you bring this restaurant back to its core foundation. The kind of establishment where guest satisfaction is our highest priority. No guest should ever have to travel all around the city to our ONLY location in New York and experience a B letter grade for our health performance. Then, get themselves ready for our extensive 86 list because for the last 8 weeks were out of their favorite appetizer, drink, or entr\u00e9e. We are simply much better than that and I know this for a fact. <br&gt;<br&gt;Managers, \u00a0please treat your employees with more compassion, respect, and appreciation (not just the ones that are easy to love). You don&amp;#39;t get credit for dealing with people who are only easy to deal with. I hope that the Queens location begins to reflect Cheesecake factory&amp;#39;s morals and values. A company where we not only take care of our guests, but our staff as well. Too many times I&amp;#39;ve witnessed managers demanding too much respect, but offering none in return. \u00a0In addition, this establishment also lacks communication. Communication is one of, if not the most important skill to have as a manager. I&amp;#39;ve seen grown adults who assert themselves as professionals, come out of their professional character out of frustration in a corporate environment, and demean their employees. These actions not only affect that employee, but the community of the entire restaurant. <br&gt;<br&gt;In conclusion, my time with Cheesecake has come to an end. I loved where I started, but unfortunately didn&amp;#39;t like where I ended. There is so much favoritism in that establishment. I worked in Queens for over 6 months and there were stations on the floor plan I never even experienced. This alone should say more than enough. If corporate gets a hand on this, I hope that they take every word seriously. If managers read this I hope they do too. <br&gt;<br&gt;Be more charismatic towards your employees and treat them like humans who are special and a blessing to their business. We are all special, we all have something, something different deep down inside of us to bring to the table. Managers, please embrace that and seek the potential in your employees.", "rating": 1, "date": "8/24/2018"}, {"text": "Tonight&amp;#39;s service was very bad, I don&amp;#39;t know what but the bartenders missed their mark.

When my daughter realized she wasn&amp;#39;t having a birthday party, she asked that we celebrate her birthday at the Cheesecake Factory. We have always had a pleasant experience at the restaurant in Ridge Hill, NY, which is by our home. <br&gt;We decided to go to the Cheesecake factory at the Queens Center Mall in Elmhurst, NY because it is closer to my parents. Plus my niece (who came from New Jersey) wanted to invite her friends from Brooklyn. We arrived at the Queens Center Mall at 7:19pm, and immediately put our names on the waiting list. We were told by the concierge that due to the size of our party (9 people) they were required to tell us that the wait might be 1 to 1.5 hrs but would most likely be called within 45 min. I then decided to order a cheesecake, which would take 1.5 hrs to cook, and chill before serving. I figured &amp;#34;perfect! We&amp;#39;ll be done eating by then&amp;#34;. I walked around the mall with my daughter to keep her awake and occupied. This is when I receive a call from my mom, who had decided to sit it out and wait. She realized while standing there that people who walked in AFTER US had eaten, paid their bill and walked out. \u00a0Upon looking further, she realized that half the restaurant was empty! When I headed back, my mom was conversing with a guy who is telling her, &amp;#34;well we are understaffed.

At approx. 8:50pm (still waiting to be seated mind you), my mom asks to speak with the manager. She comes out reluctantly, to which my mom tells her that this is horrible customer service and she&amp;#39;s not sure how she is comfortable knowing that we have been waiting for 1.5 hrs while 3/4 is the restaurant is empty. My mother then says &amp;#34;this is horrible business tactic and we will be sure to write a review on the horrible customer service we received! How can you run a business like this?&amp;#34; \u00a0The manager responds \u00a0&amp;#34;if you&amp;#39;d like to know how to run a business, I&amp;#39;m more than happy to tell you&amp;#34;!!!!

All in all, there&amp;#39;s only half a success story. \u00a0The service was also uneven, with no plates or utensils on the table even after the appetizer was served. \u00a0We finally flagged down another server to get a set and then our server comes later with another set saying she had to find the plates, etc. intimating that&amp;#39;s why it took so long. \u00a0A proper resolution to this awkwardness would be, apologize and take back the second set of plates and utensils in hand. \u00a0But no, she proceeded to put down the second set so now our small 2 person table had \u00a08 forks, four knives, 4 napkins. \u00a0That was insensitive and lazy on her part to not bring back the unnecessary sets. \u00a0Similarly, when I first sat down and as I was taking off my coat, with my hand half in the sleeve, she hovered over me to hand me the menu. \u00a0Our server needs to learn how to adjust to the customer&amp;#39;s situation and not go through the mechanical motions. \u00a0She needs to be more intuitive. \u00a0It should be about satisfying the customer and not about her. \u00a0Let me spell it out in case management reads this and is open to some customer service advice. If the customer has no hands available to take the menu, the server should place it down on the table rather than force the customer to take it with her hand still in her coat as she taking her coat off. If the table doesn&amp;#39;t have plates and silverware, get some quickly but if the customer already got some while you were away, don&amp;#39;t give them the extra set in your hands for no reason other than the fact you don&amp;#39;t want to feel like you wasted your time &amp;#34;looking&amp;#34; for them. \u00a0So the clincher is the meal cost us nearly $90 for 2 people. \u00a0Next time, if we need fast, good and inexpensive, I would go to the neighboring Joe&amp;#39;s Crab or Shake Shack or even Burger King. \u00a0I am not adverse to chains but this reminds me how bad things could be.", "rating": 1, "date": "4/14/2017"}, {"text": "Being from \u00a0the South (ATL) I am use to having the Cheesecake Factory, and I have never been disappointed.

My friends salad was missing components which were advertised on the menu and she kindly asked to have them delivered on the side. After waiting another 20 min for my food, It came back cold again. Now upset, (rightfully so) i asked for that food to be set aside and have a whole new order made because i was afraid i was going to be served the same food a third time. A manager came over and apologized for the food being placed under a heat lamp as opposed to being properly heated. By this time, my friend had received 3 ingredients that belonged on her salad to begin with, and my other friend had finished her food. I had to eat while my friends watched which was horrific. Then, the birthday girl chose her dessert and to our surprise we were charged for the birthday dessert AND for the extra meal THEY messed up to begin with.

The quality of food and service has really declined from the last time I visited the chain. My daughter was very excited upon learning the grand opening of a Cheesecake factory in NY! What 4 yr. old doesn&amp;#39;t get excited over sweets &amp;amp; desserts? <br&gt;<br&gt;The opening week was in late Oct. That was a major disappointment. It was chaotic with expected wait times to over 2 1/2 hrs. The host was overwhelmed and end up telling customers to come back next week. We end up grabbing a cheesecake for our daughter to go. And, that was a total nightmare! A single line form for ordering and another one for pick-up. Two cashiers were ringing all the customers while the pick-up line crammed all customers into the back and front of the exit doors. This push into the other line where customers were waiting to be seated. There was no management or structure whatsoever. Staff was flying all over the place. It was a zoo!<br&gt;<br&gt;We made the trip and return in the next two weeks. We ask for a table for 3. The host told us it would be a 40 minute wait. It turned into an 1 1/2 hr. wait. After you&amp;#39;re called in when signaled on the device, you have to wait on another line to get seated. Once we were seated, the assigned waitress disappeared. As we approach one of the waitstaff for a manager. The waitress returned and gave us menus and ask if we want to place our drinks in addition to a bread basket. After our drinks were placed, she disappeared for over 20 minutes. The table across from us got seated after we did. They already got their order in with the bread basket and drinks. When she returned, she offered no apology for the wait. She hurriedly asked if we were ready to place our order. Once she took our order, she was gone! We had to flag her twice to ask for utensils and bread. Regular utensil was given to our daughter that is 4. She could barely manage with the big silverware. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food was ok. I had the salmon. The sides were drenched in butter. My daughter had the chicken sliders with the fries. The sliders were less than appetizing. The chicken seem to have been left in the fryer for awhile. My husband had the burger with a salad. He was given fries instead. Normally, we would had asked to speak to a supervisor/manager on the side. Unfortunately, no one appears to know who the manager is as staff frantically runs back and forth. With our waitress disappearing half of the night, it was nearly impossible to address anything. We placed the last order for dessert- an ice cream sundae for our daughter and a cheesecake to go. Our waitress again hurriedly put the check on our table. We did not ask for the check since we were waiting for the dessert. The ice cream sundae had 3 scoops of vanilla and huge dollops of whipped cream. There was no hot fudge or cherry on top that kinda thing for a kid. We concluded this visit was the worse that you can possibly get from a waitress. I don&amp;#39;t think we plan on returning! <br&gt;<br&gt;A side note to management: please slow down the pace with the staff in the restaurant! It causes the environment to be more hectic and frantic than it really is. There are enough tables to seat everyone. It has to be addressed and organized better. It would nice for the waitstaff to remember and check in their tables once in awhile. The front has to be managed better for pick-up orders. Form a line to the side and have another cashier pack up the order so that it&amp;#39;s ready instead of ringing customers back and forth. And, the wait times have to be managed better, give a more accurate wait time to the customers.

I told my little SIL that she should&amp;#39;ve stuck with just going to hot pot, her initial decision but her sister persuaded her about CF. <br&gt;<br&gt;We sat at our table for 30 or 35 mins our food comes but the soup doesn&amp;#39;t.

We started with drinks and my fianc\u00e9 ordered a passion fruit mojito and I ordered the peach Bellini. Both drinks were really good but I liked my fianc\u00e9 mojito a little more because I could actually taste the alcohol. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the chicken bellagio which our server, Jordan discouraged him from getting because he said it did didn&amp;#39;t have any flavor and recommended the parmesan chicken. I ordered a favorite of mine the chicken stuffed tortillas. <br&gt; At least 30 minutes had passed and Jordan hadn&amp;#39;t checked on us or asked us if we wanted more drinks and we still didn&amp;#39;t have our food so my fianc\u00e9 ask for him to check on it. Jordan brings my chicken stuffed tortillas first then my fianc\u00e9 chicken Bellagio. My fianc\u00e9 food looks right but mine looks like it&amp;#39;s missing something. I noticed the sweet corn cakes are missing from the plate. I ask our server, Jordan<br&gt;Where are the corn cakes. He looks at me with a confused expression. He said that is what you ordered. I said I know, but it&amp;#39;s missing the corn cakes that give the dish that sweet with savory balance. The waiter just kept the dazed and confused look, so I asked him to bring me a menu. He comes back with the menu and starts trying to look through the menu to find it. I told him to give it to me because I know exactly what page it was on. When I turned to the page and pointed to the details of the dish where it list what&amp;#39;s in it, the waiter doesn&amp;#39;t even look at the menu instead he walks away... yes you read correctly. I point to where it says corn cakes and this guy just walks away. There happens to be another waiter, Tyrone cleaning up a table beside us and I ask him if the chicken stuffed tortillas comes with corn cakes and he said yes it does. Tyrone is the star of this story because he apologized for our bad service even though he wasn&amp;#39;t even our waiter. This restaurant doesn&amp;#39;t deserve you. <br&gt;A manager I want to call Jessica comes out and says sorry we don&amp;#39;t have any corn cakes would you like something else. Wtf? I wouldn&amp;#39;t have ordered this dish if I would have known that. She said I&amp;#39;m sorry I just found out. She said I can give you a minute to think about it. It had taken so long just to get the food I didn&amp;#39;t want to wait in that cold restaurant waiting for any more disappointment. <br&gt;Our waiter, yes that idiot that lacked social grace came to my fianc\u00e9 and asked if he was keeping his food. That&amp;#39;s how it is Jordan,really? First you was recommending food then something goes wrong with my dish and you don&amp;#39;t even say I&amp;#39;m sorry the meal wasn&amp;#39;t complete or I&amp;#39;m sorry I didn&amp;#39;t check on you guys before we got the food or after. The manager comes back out, I tell her I don&amp;#39;t want anything just take care of my fianc\u00e9 meal. The managerJessica by the way is not rude, but she is basic. Basic customer service, basic concern with a lot of basic staff. (She first was just going to offer me cheesecake for my trouble) lol. <br&gt;We asked Jordan for a box for my fianc\u00e9 food and this fool actually said I thought you said you didn&amp;#39;t want it. Now I&amp;#39;m pissed. We explained the manager comped his meal and I said it&amp;#39;s not your concern anyway seeing as you didn&amp;#39;t do anything to resolve the situation. He looks at me and says how come, I didn&amp;#39;t make the food I just brought it out. I told him that it&amp;#39;s not that there was an error that makes him responsible it&amp;#39;s because he never admitted there was a mistake, he walked away when I showed him there was something missing and didn&amp;#39;t say anything(weird) and he walked around us like I did something wrong even though my meal was wrong. I said in the future instead of trying to give your unsolicited advice on food we should order make sure you learn how to effectively communicate to customers their order will be incomplete and learn strategies in how to best resolve issues when problems arise. At the very least most waiters will say I&amp;#39;m sorry we didn&amp;#39;t have what you ordered correct or I apologize that you were disappointed with your meal.. See Jordan, simple. This is by far the WORST Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. From the wait time to get the food, bad management, to incompetent servers, this Cheesecake Factory location is a fail.

Your sarcastic tone and unfriendly disposition fits quite perfectly in this second tier establishment.

Went there around 7pm looking to have some dessert with my daughter (2 1/2 years old) and my mother. Our waitress Cherlene B. seemed very nice when she first came to greet us, but as soon as I told her I would order some dinner for my daughter and my mother and I would have just dessert, she became a super rude and arrogant person toward us. I ordered the avocado toast for my daughter, when it came it was totally burned and hard to chew, no way a 2 yrs old could eat that. The rude waitress didnt bother to come and check how the food was (even though the plate was exactly the same as they brough it, and she was walking around on the other tables next to us). She brought the desserts and still didnt ask about the food until I told her my daughter wont eat that because it was burned and hard, her answer &amp;#34;thats the way it is, thats why is called a toast, and thats exactly the way we make it&amp;#34;. Maybe she though that I dont know how to read or that I never in my life ate a &amp;#34;toast&amp;#34;. So I told her just to take it because a 2 yrs old can not chew on that, and she asked me if I wanted it to go (why would I want to take something home that I dont even want to eat there!!!??) Of course I said NO because its burned!!! And she goes like &amp;#34;so should I just throw it away? &amp;#34; (really????!!!! You can eat it yourself if thats the way its supposed to be!!!). We ate our desserts after the uncomfortable situation and as soon as we finished the last bite she just brough the check with the avocado toast on it!!!!! (I didnt know if I should get mad or just laugh at this disgusting person). <br&gt;If you dont want your tables to be used just for dessert, you should put a notice or at least let people know.

I had to write my review today. I had a FIVE STAR experience! This location is the newest of the chain, and so beautiful and spacious. My best friend and I went for my post birthday lunch earlier today when I told her The Cheesecake Factory had opened in Elmhurst a few months ago. This was a big deal for many who enjoy The Cheesecake Factory, but there aren&amp;#39;t any locations near where we live, until now! HOORAY!!! We reached about 12:15pm, and were greeted very friendly and were seated right away, They \u00a0have an enclosed outside portion and that was NICE!! I was so excited as we \u00a0got to see outside. Our server was Lajae C. and she was very pretty and awesome, and attentive to being our server. \u00a0She highly recommended the grilled Salmon with the mashed potatoes and broccoli, and I love salmon, but what a menu, it was so hard to decide on what to eat, it looked all good. I liked the fact the menus were smaller in size than a few years ago when I last ate at The Cheesecake Factory, and so many choices to choose from. They also have Gluten Free options. Server after server were passing by with huge platters for other guests. You couldn&amp;#39;t help but stare and ask what is that?? I decided on the salmon, and my friend had this massively huge burrito which was delicious! My salmon did not disappoint, it was cooked very well, tasted as good as the salmon I had when I was visiting the Dominican Republic last month. My mashed potatoes were nicely seasoned and flavorful. The broccoli was also nicely steamed, firm and tasty. The description on the menu didn&amp;#39;t do the sides justice. I wish I took photos, but I will next time. Their tea selection was also impressive. I had the chamomile Lemon tea and she also let me take another tea, the Orange and black tea flavor. I also had the strawberry lemonade that was SWEET and delicious, I had to water it down a few times, but was able to share with my friend. There was sugar on the rim also which was a cool touch! <br&gt;<br&gt;Then dessert time came, my friend didn&amp;#39;t have dessert because she was full with the amazing burrito and had some to take home too! But I had to have a cheesecake, move over delicious salmon in my tummy!! Lajae recommended the Dream Oreo Supreme, but I wanted to take a look at \u00a0my other options since I haven&amp;#39;t had their cheesecake in a long time, and OMG, OH BOY, they all looked decadent! I chose the Dream Oreo cheesecake and it was to LIVE for!!!! They have actually whole Oreo cookies inside of the cheesecake layer. Is your mouth salivating yet? Lol!! It was so yummy, and they even put Oreo pieces in the whipped cream and a giant Oreo on the side. I had ordered it to go, but had to have some while I was there. Boy that was GOOD! They even have a Happy Hour, so I got to go back and check it out. <br&gt;<br&gt;I was very pleased with our experience! and recommend this location. Yes, this is The Cheesecake Factory, so you should expect a wait to be seated, we didn&amp;#39;t have that today, but this location is worth the wait. Would you eat a restaurant that was empty and only sound you hear is the sound of crickets? Seriously? I would definitely and absolutely go back to The Cheesecake Factory in Elmhurst to try the other dishes. The prices are reasonable and the value you get with the food and large portions are fantastic. The ambiance was great. I really enjoyed sitting in the outer space as it was not as boisterous as inside, and they have a cool window that actually tilt open to let the air in, but that&amp;#39;s expected when you have happy guests eating delicious food. That&amp;#39;s awesome Feng Shui in my book, and I should know, I am a Feng Shui Expert (wink wink, shameless plug!).

Weird...and cheap. \u00a0 Did I mention we had to wait an extra five minutes to eat because my babys food wasn&amp;#39;t served with ours? Cucumber lemonade tasted (great). \u00a0or that the bread &amp;#34;was in the oven&amp;#34; and we had to wait. \u00a0All the while im thinking - cmon man, at least have the bread ready.<br&gt;<br&gt;During our meal a Hostess came back to seat someone next to us when our neighbors left. \u00a0Same thing happened. (table was dirty) \u00a0But instead of being ushered off to the side they stood over the table while she wiped the table off onto the floor...again no flatware...nothing......I also noticed \u00a0many tables complaining to the manager. \u00a0In fact - when \u00a0I went to the bathroom I could see in the kitchen someone was wearing a dangling chain preparing food (hows that for unsanitary)<br&gt;<br&gt;I hate to present problems without solutions so I will give my highest recommendation that TCF corporate get in there and retrain the house staff or change the managerial staff completely. \u00a0The back and front of the house is a mess. \u00a0 It is very poorly managed and it shows in daily operations and in the food. \u00a0Ultimately degrading the brand so many have come to love.<br&gt;<br&gt;Do not eat here.", "rating": 2, "date": "7/5/2017"}, {"text": "Horrible service.

This is when I had to physically leave my seat to look for her. Because she had disappeared into thin air for at least 20 minutes, I found a manager and asked him to heat my food up. He took it right away and I returned to my seat thinking the night would get better. I was wrong. The manager didn&amp;#39;t return with my food and it had been at least another 20 minutes. Again, I had to physically leave my seat to find my waitress, and I asked her about my food and she was completely oblivious to the fact that there were any problems with my food. I found her reaction quite interesting as she did not check on us like Cheesecake Factory employees normally do. She told me she would go to the kitchen to check on it, and as I returned to my seat another waitress was updating my party that my food was on its way shortly. I began to relax knowing that my food would be there soon. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and I normally get extra sauce so when my meal was delivered the first time the spaghetti and sauce were both cold. Unfortunately, the second time it came around the sauce was still ice cold, but they managed to heat up the spaghetti (spaghetti also tasted very different from other CF locations, wasn&amp;#39;t as good). Because we had spent almost 2 hours there, we were ready to go and paid for our food. My cousin who covered the bill receives alerts every time her card is used and before we could even write our tip in, her bank notified her that she had paid more than what our receipt was showing us. In fact, the total that showed up in her statement included exactly a 20% tip doin to the coin. We were shocked because we hadn&amp;#39;t even tipped yet so it made no sense that the tip could automatically be included.

Originally we were quoted a 55-70 minute wait time (at 3:10 pm) so we walked around the mall for a bit and came closer to the door around 55 minutes later. We checked with the hostess to make sure we hadn&amp;#39;t been called and she said the wait would be about 20 minutes later than they said. She was really nice and we were willing to wait. Finally we had a seat around 4:30. <br&gt;<br&gt;Once we experienced the service, we realized why their wait times to even get a table are so long! While nice, our server was just absent most of the time (and we really don&amp;#39;t like overly attentive servers, just reasonably prompt service!). It took over 10 minutes to get our drinks and we ordered food once the drinks came at 4:45. In the meantime, another couple was seated next to us and had a very attentive server who immediately greeted them with bread and water. They ordered food about 10 minutes after us. Their entrees arrived about 20-25 minutes later and our food hadn&amp;#39;t arrived yet. For reference, we ordered the lunch BBQ chicken salad and lunch Louisiana pasta while they each had more complex meals that should take longer to prepare. They were finished with their meal when our server finally came over to tell us it would be about 5 more minutes, they were just waiting on the pasta. Finally we got our food at 5:35, 50 minutes after we ordered it.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food itself was good, completely consistent with every Cheesecake Factory I&amp;#39;ve visited before. Our waitress was nice and got every part of the order right, but the wait times for everything was abysmal.

Valerie, with her nasty racist attitude, decides to tell my husband and I that, &amp;#34;Here in America, mushroom burgers have beef in them.&amp;#34; Um, no, not true at all.

When the menu is damn near 10 pages long and everything looks amazing and you&amp;#39;re the most indecisive person ever - ordering becomes anxiety-inducing! Came for lunch, and they have amazing lunch specials with a lot of options, served until 5.

Alas, that&amp;#39;s what this place is known for. I ate half of my meal, and still had a whole other large portion to take home. I ordered the meatloaf special, which was two large chunks of meat, along with mashed potatoes and gravy, and a corn succotash. I really enjoyed it, though my dining partner said that he felt that it was too breadcrumb-y and wished he could taste more meat. He ordered the ribeye steak, which I only had a quick bite of and was indifferent to, but he said it was tasty.

Basically a layer of pumpkin cheesecake sandwiched between a pumpkin pie crust and topping. The crust was kind of hard to get through, but yummy nonetheless. My only gripe is a general one, and it&amp;#39;s that they go way overboard with the whipped cream, which isn&amp;#39;t even needed to begin with. Also tasted the white chocolate macadamia nut blondie one, which I had before a long time ago, and while you can&amp;#39;t go wrong with that combo, it is excessively sweet, so be prepared for that.

Worst experience at a Cheesecake Factory. Expected a long wait since the place just opened but didn&amp;#39;t expect to wait over 30 minutes for some lemon wedges for our drinks. Ordered factory nachos and it came out wrong, was promised it would be fixed and it came out wrong again. Ordered sandwich without Mayo and surprise, it had Mayo. Fries cold and salty. Do your self a favor and head to Long Island or white plains!", "rating": 2, "date": "11/6/2016"}, {"text": "I don&amp;#39;t like leaving bad reviews but i have to because I left kinda upset, first the wait we were told 10 mins we were sat in 25, I use to be a hostess and I know better to over quote then under quote especially if it&amp;#39;s packed. Now let&amp;#39;s start with our server Denise pretty nice lady, however she was a bit slow and forgetful all forgivable especially since this place just opened. We never received bread and other servers had to keep stopping at our table to offer us a refill, for the food itself boy was I pissed when we were told the appetizer we wanted they didn&amp;#39;t have which was the fried mac n cheese balls which was fine but that meant I couldn&amp;#39;t get that as my side which is what I normally get when I go to any other Cheesecake Factory . My husband and I opted for the hot spinach dip and chips it was good nothing special, what really threw me off was that when my husband ordered his ribeye they said they were out....so first Mac n cheese and now a ribeye????i was baffled how a restaurant could be out of something? Anyway I ordered the Parmesan and herb crusted chicken which was really good and my husband got the same thing and really enjoyed it. When it was time to order dessert we were so full but wanted to take dessert home we even conversed with Denise how we couldn&amp;#39;t eat anymore and she said it is nice to eat at home in your pjs, we thought we were all on the same page that we wanted dessert to go, out comes Denise with 2 plates of cheese cake, we were confused especially since we joked about eating the cheesecake in our pjs so we tell Denise and she goes I thought you said you wanted it for here and took the plates back, my husband and I looked at each other a laughed in confusion since we did say to go twice but it&amp;#39;s fine maybe she was overwhelmed they did double seat her which means 2of her tables were sat at the same time, me and my husband then a family of 4 which is unfair there should&amp;#39;ve been a 3-5 min gap for her tables to be sat. Now to the cheesecake it alone deserves 5 stars I got an Oreo cheese cake my husband got the s&amp;#39;mores cheesecake my god they were amazing if I never come back her for the food I will definitely come back for the cheesecake. I really hope they fix the problems because it&amp;#39;d be quite a shame that the first Cheesecake Factory in queens doesn&amp;#39;t live up to the hype and the other cheesecake factories.", "rating": 3, "date": "11/6/2016"}, {"text": "I had a very pleasant experience with my first visit ever to The Cheesecake Factory.

I met a friend here for dinner and I arrived before her and I was seated before she got there. I waited at my table for about 15 minutes and was not asked if I needed anything until she got there. Not even served a water. Once she arrived the waiter came up and we ordered. We got spinach dip as an appetizer and it was ok. We ordered our entrees as well. My chicken Marsala was fine, but she ordered the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. When she received it, it was simply chicken and noodles. There were no peas, mushrooms, pancetta, or tomatoes. We told the server and he offered to bring out the missing ingredients. We found this odd because we did not want a plate of the missing ingredients so we asked for it to be made again. After 45 minutes, we still had no replacement and we asked the waiter where it was. He said he would go check and another 20 minutes passed with nothing. We finally called for a manager and he went to check on it. 15 minutes passed and our food finally came out. The lady brought our food to the table, dropped it aggressively in front of my friend and said &amp;#34;you&amp;#39;re welcome&amp;#34; without asking if it looked okay. She gave us no opportunity to say thank you and we were blatantly disrespected. We called the manager again and told him what had happened. He simply apologized and was not offering anything else. I had to tell him that I was not paying for her food and he finally said he would take it off and offered us cheesecake. I was ok with the outcome the manager offered, but I felt like this all could have been avoided if the staff here was professional and knew how to properly treat their guests. At the end of the day the rude lady who delivered our food caused the company to lose $30+ and she needs to understand that if she acts like that she should find a job somewhere else.

This is after waiting for 30mins at least before being told that they ran out of one of our orders. The manager offered us a free cheesecake for the inconvenience but when I asked for the bill from another waitress as I can&amp;#39;t seem to find where our waitress went, the complimentary cheesecake was billed until I pointed it out to our waitress. Have to get our cheesecake to go instead of eating it there as it was almost closing time. This is only after I stood up to look for the counter just to pay the bill so we can leave and remained standing by our table. Almost wanted to just walked out of there after paying the bill at the front instead. And to top it all, a party of 7 people arrived after us but got served and left before us.

I got the Shrimp scampi and Steak combo (22$) and asked for a medium rare. I got three pieces of steak that were the size of chicken nuggets, well done, and three pieces of shrimp with a small scoop of potato mashed in the center of the plate. I&amp;#39;m sorry, but seriously? For $22?? The waitress was still giving attitude after she messed up my order. The manager came by and did nothing. No apology, nothing. I asked for a pasta instead, who which she said &amp;#34;better late than never&amp;#34; when she handed it to me. It might as well have been never because that shit was bland as hell, I dumped at least a teaspoon of salt and pepper onto it in order for it to taste like anything. Still, it tasted like flour.
