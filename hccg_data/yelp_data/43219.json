Again I&amp;#39;m thankful it was not something worse but it was another disappointment. The waiter did apologize and brought me out another one that was hot but it was not a good veggie burger.

Unfortunately, the meal was both much more expensive, and much more underwhelming than anticipated. <br&gt;<br&gt;I started with the loaded tots appetizer which was delicious! Highly recommend! I also had a blood orange margarita which was just okay, and for $11.50 I expected much better! <br&gt;<br&gt;For dinner I had the bang bang chicken and shrimp which was just under $20 and was also just okay. The description said it was a spicy dish which is what sold me, but on a scale of 1-10 of spicy I&amp;#39;d say it was a 1. I&amp;#39;m not sure if they just forgot to put it in, but the whole meal was pretty bland. In addition, the serving size was huge! I took home way more than I ate and 3 people could have easily filled up with this one plate of food. While It&amp;#39;s nice to get your &amp;#34;bang for your buck&amp;#34; in portions, I would have preferred the bang to come from the quality of the meal.

I have no clue why I picture this in my head, but it does sorta set a stage for what I expect when I plan to visit. It&amp;#39;s a very family friendly establishment, it can be rather lavish, and it&amp;#39;s pretty much what folks are deeming &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; these days. \u00a0Now basic isn&amp;#39;t necessarily a bad thing. To me is just means, common or popular. <br&gt;<br&gt;This specific location of The Cheesecake Factory is right in the middle of Easton shopping center. This means there&amp;#39;s a lot of parking surrounding it but depends on the time of year, day, etc. you may have to walk a bit. When you&amp;#39;re walking in to give your name to the host, you&amp;#39;ll notice a great patio! I always choose to sit outside if the weather is nice. This spot also has a good sized bar and an enormous dining area. It honestly feels never ending. This is a good thing considering how busy this location is. It always seems like there&amp;#39;s a line out the door however I never seem to have to wait very long before I&amp;#39;m being taken back to a table. <br&gt;<br&gt;I feel like the last several times I&amp;#39;ve visited I&amp;#39;ve gotten the same waitress. She is a total sweetheart and has definitely been working there for a while. She&amp;#39;s always quick to greet the table, take drink orders, bring out bread, and she regularly checks in to make sure everything is going well. Speaking of bread, I love that they always bring out warm, freshly baked bread. Usually sourdough and honey wheat, both fantastic, especially when you&amp;#39;re starving! I don&amp;#39;t have a go-to menu item when I visit. I tend to try something new each time. I can confidently say that the Almond Crusted Salmon Salad is delicious! Big thumbs up! It comes tossed in a light lemon vinaigrette and it&amp;#39;s very refreshing! I also enjoy the Greek salad on the small plate menu, the avocado eggrolls on the appetizer menu, and the pastas are tasty and filling (the portions feel huge). Now, when it comes to down the actual cheesecake, I could go on and on forever. Every single one I&amp;#39;ve had has been amazing. The white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake is absolutely heavenly. I take a bite and it&amp;#39;s pretty close to an outta body experience - no lie. The white chocolate macadamia nut is also a top choice. I love the crunch of the nuts. It gives it some much-needed texture. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I guess what I&amp;#39;m trying to say is the food and the service has always been pretty good here. Its consistent and consistent is nice and comforting. It&amp;#39;s why people visit the same restaurants over and over again. That&amp;#39;s likely why I keep coming back to The Cheesecake Factory when I&amp;#39;m hungry and it&amp;#39;s near by.

Go to the back ladies. <br&gt;Our server did apologize once though- at the end after we paid about the appetizers but it wasn&amp;#39;t sincere, quick, and she promptly walked away. <br&gt;I was just going to write this off as one bad trip, as I&amp;#39;ve gone before and my service was great- I wasn&amp;#39;t going to write a review but the last straw was when our server came back to us to ask us why she received such a bad tip..which is that cheesecake factory policy? because...it should have been obvious- well my friend that paid went on to explain why she received a bad tip- about how the appetizers, the coffee- she tried to say she can&amp;#39;t control when the food comes out- which is somewhat true-but in this circumstance no. I don&amp;#39;t know if you use micros or aloha but any server knows not to put appetizers and pasta in at the same time- as most places you have the pasta pre-cooked so all you have to do is deep fry the chicken, toss in the sauce and plate them- so yeah they cook way faster than all of the appetizers we ordered. She either put them in at the same time or \u00a0way too close to one another- like she rang them in less then five minutes later.

My excuse was that I had a gift certificate, but I imagine most people are choosing to send their dining dollars to Cheesecake Factory over one of the local great restaurants they could discover through Yelp.<br&gt;2.) They&amp;#39;re obviously known for their large portions, and the food is actually pretty good, but everything tastes good when it&amp;#39;s made with two sticks of butter and topped with cheddar cheese. The menu is also very large, which would be good if you&amp;#39;re with a bunch of picky eaters, but it was honestly a bit overwhelming and hard to figure out which items would be the best choices.<br&gt;3.) The decor in this place seems to be having some identity issues. There seemed to be Mediterranean, Egyptian, Italian, French, and possibly Jersey Shore influence in the design. Again, it seems like they&amp;#39;re trying to have as many concepts as possible to please everyone, but it just comes off strange and identity-less.<br&gt;4.) The prices are a little high, but I guess many find comfort knowing that they are going to get a decent meal and plenty of leftovers.<br&gt;5.) The service is pretty good. No complaints from my visit. <br&gt;6.) By the end of our meal we were stuffed, but since it&amp;#39;s The Cheesecake Factory, we felt obligated to get a slice (plus cheesecake is delicious). We got a piece of chocolate mousse cheesecake to go and it tasted great. For being called The Cheesecake Factory, that does seem to be where their strength is.
