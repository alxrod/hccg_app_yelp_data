We ordered one adult entree, and one child&amp;#39;s entree. I had to remind the server to bring our drinks.

Also, the food took forever to get, and they weren&amp;#39;t that busy. \u00a0AND.... the chicken was very dry, and my daughter wouldn&amp;#39;t eat it. <br&gt;<br&gt;But the part that bothered me the most was that our server - after attempting to call her over to my table (I politely called her by saying &amp;#34;excuse me miss.&amp;#34; ) I was waived off and told to hold on, not because she was helping anyone, but because she was having a conversation with two men about their freshly inked tattoos.

Last week, my friend and I were deciding where to grab dinner from, as many different options were open in the Old Town Pasadena area. We decided upon Cheesecake, as we were craving pasta with the recent cold weather. We were directed to Takeout and placed our order with the Takeout employee. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and my friend ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. We debated ordering an appetizer to share, our eyes on the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. I had asked the Takeout employee how much the Tamale Cakes cost, and he informed me of the price. I shook my head &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; and said &amp;#34;No thank you, just the pastas&amp;#34;. After splitting the check, paying, and leaving to walk around Old Town Pasadena, we were both contemplating the split price we paid. Approximately $29 each. How could 2 pastas cost $60? When we returned back to pick up our food, I asked the same Takeout employee who had taken our order why the final price was so high for 2 pastas. He said that we ordered the 2 pastas and the Tamale Cakes. I corrected him, informing him that we did &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; order the Tamale Cakes, and I clearly told him no thank you. His response was, &amp;#34;you said you wanted them&amp;#34;, and he walked away, I assume to grab a manager to fix the situation. A few minutes later, an older hispanic woman who appeared to be the manager walks up to where our order was taken, performs several actions on the Posi Computer, reprints receipts, hands my friend and I our &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; totals, and says &amp;#34;You should only see one charge on your account&amp;#34;. She tells the Takeout employee to remove the Tamale Cakes from our already bagged order, and he does. We signed the new split checks, handed them to her (the manager), she gives the checks to the Takeout employee, and walks away. At no point does this &amp;#34;manager&amp;#34; greet my friend and I upon initially walking up to the Takeout computer. No apology for the overcharge on our cards, nor for the inconvenience this caused, as our meals were already ready to go, getting colder by the minute. After handing her back the new checks, again, no apology for the overcharge, minimal eye contact, as she seemed to be annoyed and angry with US about the situation, and then walked away with the Tamale Cakes the Takeout employee had removed. Didn&amp;#39;t bother saying &amp;#34;Have a good night&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Thank you for coming&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m sorry this happened&amp;#34;. I asked the Takeout employee for her name before leaving the restaurant, he informed me that her name is CANDICE. The level of unprofessionalism with this &amp;#34;manager&amp;#34; is truly sad and disappointing to witness and have experienced, knowing the high caliber Cheesecake&amp;#39;s reputation has always held. Extremely unprofessional, bland and rude &amp;#34;personality&amp;#34;, non-apologetic, seemingly making it our fault for what happened, and to top it off, walking away without saying anything to my friend and I. Not to mention her bra strap was clearly showing and sticking out from her shirt. The professionalism I know Cheesecake to hold was utterly non-existent during this entire process. When it came time to eat our food, of course our food was cold, the pasta was hard, appearing to be undercooked, and the chicken in my Louisiana Chicken Pasta had a rubbery texture, indicating it was also undercooked. A truly disappointing experience with Cheesecake after not eating here for years. I have always gone to the Westfield Santa Anita Mall location, which I have never EVER had this problem with there.

My husband and I stopped by for a quick dinner around 9pm on Sunday and were seated after a couple minute wait. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our server came by and was prompt with taking our drink and food orders. We had the Warm Crab and Artichoke dip because on a previous trip to San Diego, we had this and it was utterly delicious. Except.... this time it wasn&amp;#39;t. In San Diego, the dip was very creamy and only had crab and small chunks of artichoke. I don&amp;#39;t know what was going on with this one but it came with giant chunks of artichoke and... BREAD? The dip was filled with chunks of soggy bread, like half the dip was just soggy croutons or something. I&amp;#39;d imagine this is a good way to beef up portions without using expensive ingredients. I hope you enjoy bread on your bread. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the Grilled Porkchop and my husband got their Factory Burger. Our server dropped my chop off with no knife, so I had to flag her down to ask for one and she stopped by without saying anything and just stared at me like I was bothering her. I asked for a knife and some more water. Sat there for a while waiting since I couldn&amp;#39;t cut the pork chop, until she finally came back and dropped it off without any apology. I guess steak knives are a luxury at Cheesecake Factory nowadays. <br&gt;<br&gt;The chop was tasty. The beans were NOT trimmed at all. I hope they&amp;#39;re at least washed. The amount of mashed potato was grossly disproportionate to anything else but who&amp;#39;s gonna complain about more food? <br&gt;<br&gt;My husband&amp;#39;s burger was kind of a disaster.

They were just standing in line like everyone else! The second hostess stepped in to check our confirmation. She told him that it would be 10-15 mins and to wait outside. 45 mins later my husband is still standing out side, as the red head brings food out to everyone else, completely ignoring us! As if we were not there! The hostess was a mess! She even had to chase another patron down the street because she gave him the wrong order and then was rude about it! My husband finally gave up, went inside and asked what was going on with our food and they say &amp;#34;oh! Your food is right here, but you have to make sure it is all there.&amp;#34; ..... and guess what, it was lukewarm. It had been sitting there!

I was out to dinner with my friend and her entire family. When it came time to order, I ordered a veggie burger. Not the impossible burger, just a typical black bean, rice, veggie burger. When our meals came, I was surprised to find that my so-called &amp;#34;veggie burger&amp;#34; was not a veggie burger. It was very clearly some sort of meat burger, with mushrooms in it. Because the meat was lighter, it was most likely a turkey burger. So, I politely called the waiter over and asked if they perhaps got my order wrong, and gave me a turkey burger rather than a veggie burger. The waiter came over, looked at my burger, saw the mushrooms in it, and proceeded to tell me that this was definitely a veggie burger, because of the mushrooms. Now because I was a guest of my friend with her entire family, I did not want to cause of scene or seem high maintenance, so I just said &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; and that was that. You might be thinking the same way the waiter was, &amp;#34;well if there are mushrooms in the burger, its got to be a veggie burger, right?&amp;#34;. If you are thinking this, you are wrong. I looked over the menu again, and there was a turkey burger with mushrooms on the menu. At this point, I was certain that what was on my plate before me was absolutely not a veggie burger. This was a turkey burger with mushrooms. And frankly, I think it is pretty easy to tell the difference between meat and vegetables, and this was most certainly meat.

We felt uncomfortable so we asked the manager to have a new waiter. She seemed to have complied, however the same waiter kept coming back to serve us and it made us even more uncomfortable. I went back to speak with the manager and she said &amp;#34;yes this guy is responsible for your specific area, is there a problem!?&amp;#34; As if this was our problem and they didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong. They completely ignored my original request. So we were stuck with this rude waiter even after asking the manager for a different one. Not only that, the food tasted completely bland.<br&gt;<br&gt;So after that experience we decided we wanted to avoid dealing with their terrible customer service, and opted to order their food through a delivery app instead. However, the problems do not go away there. For one, they NEVER follow the instructions correctly. Do you want parmesan cheese and peppers with your pizza? Good luck, that request gets fulfilled at a rate of about 1 in 5, or 20%. <br&gt;<br&gt;One time we asked for pesto sauce on the side and they gave us pasta with NO PESTO SAUCE AT ALL. Wtf?

I have dined at this location here and there when I was in high school (that was 10-15 years ago). But have dined at other Cheesecake Factory locations over the years and am sad to see that the food quality has gone down hill within the last few years. Anyways, on my most recent visit to this location (yesterday afternoon around 2 pm for a late light lunch), my husband and I were seated at a small table near the kitchen. These are the items we ordered:<br&gt;<br&gt;Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls, $10.95 prior to tax- My husband wanted something light since he had a big (late) breakfast and decided upon these spring rolls. I had low expectations for these spring rolls because with an American restaurant making spring rolls, I just had a feeling they wouldn&amp;#39;t be good. And well, my suspicions were correct. These 3 rolls (pretty expensive for 3) were poorly wrapped and the wrong type of noodles were used in them. Also these summer rolls are supposed to have shrimp. Only one roll had 1 shrimp and the other 2 had none. I did like the peanut flavored sauce and the sweet chili sauce that came with the rolls though (these are the same sauces that come with the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which my husband should have ordered in the first place because that actually taste good, although it is not a light appetizer).<br&gt;<br&gt;Luau Salad (Lunch portion), $10.95 prior to tax- The lunch portion size (you can order lunch portions until 5 pm) is actually a good size for one person (I shared part of my salad with my husband). The presentation of this salad was pretty. It comes with 2 large fried won ton pieces. It isn&amp;#39;t exactly healthy so I didn&amp;#39;t finish it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Whenever I order a salad, I always order for the dressing to be on the side. In this salad, there are pieces of mango, cucumber slices, sliced bell peppers, green beans, macadamia nuts and sesame seeds. The sweetness of the mango was good enough that this salad didn&amp;#39;t need the dressing (I had a little of the dressing and it does go well with the salad, just in case you are someone who just has to have dressing on your salad). I love the different textures, flavors and crunch.<br&gt;<br&gt;Strawberry Lemonade, $3.95 prior to tax- This lemonade was pretty bad. The lemonade tasted too sour and tasted as if rotten fruit was made with it. When we got a 2nd glass, it still had the same taste. The reason being was that our server just ladled out the drink from a large container that was already premade (so our 1st glass wouldn&amp;#39;t taste any different from the 2nd until someone makes a new batch... but I bet it will still taste the same). <br&gt;------------------------------<br&gt;(Total= $34.95 after tax and tip) <br&gt;<br&gt;Service was just average and really could have been better attentive (especially it being in the late afternoon when the restaurant was not busy).

I was then told they only take reservations during the first hour. When I asked the hostess on the phone where I could find that information (on the website, etc.), she was confused, then flustered, then, being asked again, she said she was new and didn&amp;#39;t know. <br&gt;<br&gt;We had a mix-up of some kind on being called to our table. The cell phone was rung, then we were sent back to the bar for another 10 minutes. We&amp;#39;d already closed our bar tab, I&amp;#39;m not sure what the mix-up was, since I was the birthday girl, I didn&amp;#39;t get involved. I was just glad our spots were still available. Overall, our wait was just over the quoted 30-40 minutes. <br&gt;<br&gt;After a very long delay (shorthanded???), our table-ordered cocktails arrived - after the hot appetizers and my martini included an eyelash or similar. (It didn&amp;#39;t have mascara on it, so it didn&amp;#39;t come from any of us.) The wait for drinks, including the replacement, was quite long and without explanation. The only drink our server was on top of, was coffee for one of us.<br&gt;<br&gt;A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT was that, even with the extensive menu, it was a challenge to find something for one of our group that has serious food allergies. No potatoes beyond french fries without dairy?!?!? We were told the smashed potatoes contained sour cream, and there is no baked potato option. Broccoli is great - but not exactly an indulgement. <br&gt;<br&gt;The final straw was that at the end of our meal, we were approached by a previously-unseen employee, all in black, who abruptly asked &amp;#34;Do you need something else?&amp;#34; as though we were in the way. We were actually waiting for the additional &amp;#34;To Go&amp;#34; food one of us ordered as well as our packed up leftovers. Our actual server had nicely offered to keep them together in back until we were finished and ready to go. The employee was told why were waiting, he took off before we&amp;#39;d finished getting the words out and then returned and essentially through 8 bags of food at us.

It&amp;#39;s use of cheap overly used sugar keeps you coming back for more. \u00a0If you come here, you&amp;#39;re only wasting your own time and money. <br&gt;<br&gt;REST OF THE REVIEW BELOW:<br&gt;<br&gt;1st Visit (take out):<br&gt;For take out I got a regular cheesecake and key lime cheesecake. Both were just under $9. They were both too sweet and too rich. They have a thick layer of cream cheese and have hardly any crust. My favorite part is the crust! Really a disappointment and WAAY overpriced for the quality you get and it&amp;#39;s only 1 slice. I&amp;#39;d rather buy a whole pie or cake for just a few bucks more. <br&gt;<br&gt;2nd Visit (dine in, but got no service):<br&gt;Why do people like this place??? I mean really. There are so many other better places to choose from. <br&gt;<br&gt;DINING IN:<br&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what happened: I sat down, was served bread and was left alone for 20 minutes. WTF? I never had this happen to me at a restaurant before. I even asked another waiter about the problem and still no one came. I didn&amp;#39;t want to waste my time anymore so I left. <br&gt;<br&gt;A Comment on the Menu:<br&gt;While I was waiting for 20 minutes I was looking over the menu and it&amp;#39;s ALL American-ized food. Burgers, pasta, and typical breakfast &amp;amp; sides. The reason I&amp;#39;m pointing this out is because if you really want good food, in my experience, I would recommend going to a restaurant that specializes in a particular type of food, meaning if you want a particular type of dish then you should go to an Italian, Southern, or Asian restaurant. The Cheesecake Factory is like a one-stop-shop for all your food needs, which is my theory why people who can&amp;#39;t make up their minds eat here. Next time say to yourself, &amp;#34;Hey, I never had [Indian/Spanish/Peruvian/Vegan] food. Let&amp;#39;s go there instead.&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;3rd Visit (dine in):<br&gt;- Beet salad = slightly on the sweet side. Great combo of flavors. The 2 red and purple beets gave it a meaty texture. Pecans added crunch, but they should not have been candied pecans. Baby arugula added a smooth, mellow vibe. Cheese was creamy and mellowed out the overly sweet notes. Overall, too sweet. 3/5<br&gt;<br&gt;- Spicy Cashew Chicken = way too sweet. Tasted like they chose a teriyaki sauce that had the most amount of corn syrup. It wasn&amp;#39;t spicy at all. I assume it&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s cheaper to pay for corn syrup than it is to pay for spices.

This is 5 stars because of the food and only the foos. Yes lines can be long, but i&amp;#39;ve been there close to Saturday midnight and Sunday evening, and we were seated right away (party less than 4). <br&gt;<br&gt;Yes your waiter can be a bit of an ass. One waiter actually checked up on us, another time they sort of ignored us, but it didn&amp;#39;t bother me. All the tables around us were full, and they kept filling up, so I can understand it can be a little hectic. But there is also amazing service, very fast with the bread (just request the black bread dammit) and helpful with selection. Hell they&amp;#39;re also great to call- I lost an item and the front desk was so sweet about it!<br&gt;<br&gt;Anyways, I won&amp;#39;t let a bit of bad service get in the way of the 5 stars-- because the food is freaking amazing! This is a great spot for dinner or lunch, the portions are huge, appetizer and entree alike, and the cheesecake makes for a great slice! <br&gt;<br&gt;An entree I highly recommend is the eggplant burger. Yes you heard me, eggplant. If you&amp;#39;ve had enough burgers as I have, bison or angus, it&amp;#39;s definitely nice to eat something else. The Cheesecake Factory&amp;#39;s eggplant burger is definitely a unique treat. It&amp;#39;s a huge burger, extremely savory and fulfilling. The side of fries is also very very generously portioned. Instantly loved!<br&gt;<br&gt;For sides, I&amp;#39;ve tasted the quesadillas, nacho chips with buffalo (?) chicken and the sweet potato fries. The chips platter was insanely huge, definitely worth it if you just want to snack with another person. It was extremely savory, you get chicken, salsa, guac, and all the cheese ever. The quesadillas were a bit small/thin, but nevertheless tasty. And lastly the sweet potato fries... No regrets. It was another huge plate of just sweet potato fries. Top notch, soft, fresh, salty and sweet, doesn&amp;#39;t taste that oily.<br&gt;<br&gt;And lastly for the Cheesecake I taste: the something something Tuxedo cheesecake. Hahah I forgot the name oops, but I was already hooked on the fact it was called Tuxedo! It was chocolate, vanilla, and more chocolate! It did not taste bland or dull or stale, it melted in your mouth it was a sweet delight and it was damn fancy good. If you&amp;#39;re gonna be at the Cheesecake Factory, order a fancy cheesecake right?<br&gt;<br&gt;Anyways, the dinners I&amp;#39;ve had here have been more than fulfilling (yes you can box it.

The shrimp and chicken were hard and dry, the veggies were way too soft and the pasta was mushy. We also had the ribeye steak because it was just one of those nights where you felt like ordering steak at the Cheesecake Factory. The meat was tough though cooked to our desired doneness. Our waitress was as nice as can be and these two stars are for her. I know she sensed our frustration. She kept apologizing but she was stretched thin at the start of the dinner service already. Poor girl. I know I&amp;#39;m not going to be having a 5-star experience at a Cheesecake Factory and most especially not this location since I&amp;#39;ve been here many times but tonight was just exceptionally bad.

We ask for double servings of spicy chicken on our nachos and as the manager expedite she only gave us a serving of chicken while claiming she gave us two. She said for each serving of chicken she gives 7 oz per serving. Since we ask for more chicken shouldn&amp;#39;t she give us 14 oz of chicken yet when we got our nachos we got maybe at most 4 oz. She tried arguing with us on how they measure every amount of meat that they serve. Yet, out of her own good heart she decides to not charge us for the chicken we order and that she promise for another 7 oz of chicken. As we got the extra chicken we ask for she probably only gave us another 3 oz. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure we got less than 14 oz of chicken (more like 8 oz total that after she promise another serving of chicken) she dared charge us another $3. I don&amp;#39;t mind paying for what I ordered but how would you feel if someone short change you. Such an unprofessional manager she argue with us and lied to our faces saying that she put double servings yet she didn&amp;#39;t. I used to plan for meal servings and I guarantee you that we had at most one serving of chicken (7oz). To be fair if the manager was really sure of the serving size why not bring out the scale and if you are right I will pay for what I eat. If your wrong then you should apologize and not charge for the extra chicken. <br&gt;<br&gt;We also ordered the egg roll sampler which was great because you get to try four different egg rolls. Avocado was the best but at the same time it hard to mess up with Avocado egg roll. It also hard to mess up with nachos. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you are planning on cutting short on meat portions maybe you shouldn&amp;#39;t tell people about the exact amount of oz you serve for your customer. As a scientist, we do conversion and weigh things on scale everything so I know I didn&amp;#39;t get what I paid for. I been to this location before and I ordered the nachos and this was the first time I had such a bad experience.

I hate it when people straight up lied to my face. <br&gt;<br&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk about customer service at this location. We had to flag our waitress 3 times to get their attention to get water or any sort of service. On the check they ask for 22% tip yet they didn&amp;#39;t really serve us or ever once check back on us. How dare you ask us or demand us for tips when you didn&amp;#39;t even do your job. This was at 5pm when there&amp;#39;s many empty seats and it not like they were busy. <br&gt;<br&gt;Another thing was when we ordered a key lime cheesecake to go the cheesecake tasted pretty old and stale. I would never come back to this location unless I have to and I would recommend people going to other locations. Worst service and food compare to other cheesecake locations by far.

My plate comes and it LOOKS delicious the chicken www great moist and tender the mashed potatoes were dry. Almost as if it is the last bath for the night and they aren&amp;#39;t making any fresh. I send them back and ask for green beans. The green beans come out and they are burnt there is a puddle of brown oil at the bottom of the plate. There was literally like charcoal flakes on the plate.

She came over and asked what I was having and I told her my issues with the dry cold mashed potatoes and now the burnt ass oily green beans.

That was done on PURPOSE. B#%^ please quit diffusing responsibility and own up to the fact that this is wrong. I subconsciously felt that she thought because we were black we wanted our mean competed but that is my own personal feeling. So I asked her to taste them she looked at me like I was asking her to drink polyjuice potion. So you will serve these green beans but won&amp;#39;t eat them \u00a0*mental note made* so I asked her &amp;#34;are your green beans cooked in oil or butter&amp;#34; my thought process was if the skillet was too hot the butter would brown hence for the murky substance at the bottom of the plate. Logically speaking. She leaves the table and returns and says &amp;#34;Oil&amp;#34; so now I&amp;#39;m like that&amp;#39;s some dirty dark oil to be cooking my green beans in.

If you really want to come here, just order the cheesecake to-go and leave as soon as you can wiggle your way through! <br&gt;<br&gt;Instead of eating mock-cultural food, go to the actual restaurants instead, where you get much better tasting food.

When I got the fries, I actually in my mind, and verbally, said &amp;#34;noooooo.&amp;#34; Like Luke Skywalker finding out Vader is his father nooo. Because the fries changed. Not sure if it&amp;#39;s this location, or they changed everywhere, but the fries are no longer skinny and crispy. They are the fat fries that everyone serves. Not that I have anything against fat fries, they are still good, but the skinny fries are what made them unique because not many places have them. It sounds like a personal gripe, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t have mind if they tasted good.... not really. They tasted they&amp;#39;ve been sitting under the heat lamp for a while. <br&gt;<br&gt;They gave me a couple onion rings with it, which was nice, but most of it was batter. How much, like a legit inch of it. If you like that kind of thing, hey go it, but i like tasting some of my onion in my onion rings. If there is too much batter it&amp;#39;s not balanced and the flavor is too overpowering. Also one other minor gripe on food, depending if you want to view this as one or not, the the ketchup taste like one of those knock off want to be ketsup. You know when Mr. Burns was at the grocery store and couldn&amp;#39;t pick between the two bottles... yeah it was like that. It could be home made, idk, but if it is.... it needs work.<br&gt;<br&gt;With that being said, I would have given this a 3 star if it weren&amp;#39;t for 1 other factor.... the service. I read other reviews and yes service here sucks. The waiters and waitresses were nice don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, but they sucked on everything else. They checked up on us once after our food came out, and only because we looked depressed and upset. Because of that we didn&amp;#39;t get refills on drinks, extra sauces we wanted, extra plates, etc. I think the manager checked up on us also, but also only because we had our heads down and looked disapointed. I was gonna say because we came during closing time, so I would understand if they wanted to pack up or they were just tired. But after seeing what other people said.... yeah it&amp;#39;s not just me. <br&gt;<br&gt;Again, I actually like this chain, but this one really needs work. I&amp;#39;m willing to give it another shot in the future, just be aware this wouldn&amp;#39;t be my first pick as of now. With being in downtown pasadena surrounded by other good places, it&amp;#39;s really hard to pick this place if i know i can get better on food and service. 2 stars.", "rating": 2, "date": "11/20/2015"}, {"text": "If you talk smack on this place I&amp;#39;ll slap you.

For this reason, an afternoon trip to Pasadena with Nicandrew included a stop at the chain most cited as a portion-control-killing obesity cause, the Cheesecake Factory!! And I get it - their portions are kinda ridiculous. That&amp;#39;s why you should just go for Happy Hour, have a fantastic cocktail and a large portion-ed appetizer and be on your merry way!<br&gt;<br&gt;Which is exactly what our crew did. We dropped in at 4pm, when Happy Hour starts and were glad we were just there for Happy Hour since there was a wait for the restaurant. Happy Hour is served at the bar area and at the nearby high-tables. A couple spots cleared at the bar when we arrived so we took a seat and then a few minutes to make a choice on their wicked-crazy food Happy Hour options; for real, so many delish-sounding options between $4-6!<br&gt;<br&gt;The drink choice was a little easier. Besides $5 well drinks, $5 wines by the glass, and $4 select draft beers, they also offer 4 classic cocktails - mojito, Long Island iced tea, margarita, cosmopolitan - and a specialty called J.W.&amp;#39;s Pink Lemonade for only $5. As dorky as it sounds, sometimes it&amp;#39;s nice to see the specialty drinks listed out like that. I love Long Island&amp;#39;s, but always seem to forget that they&amp;#39;re out there waiting to be enjoyed. Seeing it listed on the menu - well, I just had to have one! Nic had a tasty margarita and Drew enjoyed the mojito, which our bartender freshly made right before us. All the drinks were pretty right on, but I think the mojito was my fav.<br&gt;<br&gt;After a starter of their delish white &amp;amp; honey-wheat (I think?) bread, Nicandrew ended up going with the artichoke-crab dip for $5.95 and I had an order of the Avocado Eggrolls served with a tamarind dipping sauce for $5. Being the Cheesecake Factory, the eggrolls were actually three whole eggrolls cut in half - more than enough food for one person! Awesomely good though.<br&gt;<br&gt;So that was the food and drink...

Luckily, and I don&amp;#39;t know if it was because we were buzzed, but I swear when they dimmed the lights around 4:30, the crowd got quieter! I say dim lights all the time, baby!<br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, we had a fun time and the chain restaurant Happy Hour didn&amp;#39;t disappoint! The only disappointment (and it&amp;#39;s kinda major) is that I just don&amp;#39;t understand why HH only runs weekdays from 4-6pm. I know people have more flexible schedules in Los Angeles, but all my working friends don&amp;#39;t get off work until at least 5:30, so I&amp;#39;ll never understand an HH that only lasts til 6, especially if it&amp;#39;s weekday only. And for the Cheesecake Factory where Happy Hour is served at the bar-area only, I really don&amp;#39;t think a 2-hour weekend HH could hurt business that much.<br&gt;<br&gt;HAPPY HOUR TIMES: Monday-Friday; 4-6pm<br&gt;DRINK DEALS: $5 Specialty Cocktails, well drinks &amp;amp; wines by the glass, $ 15 pitchers of sangria, $10 pitchers of beer, $5 wines by the glass, $4 select draft beers<br&gt;FOOD DEALS: Tons of Food options from $4-6", "rating": 4, "date": "4/18/2011"}, {"text": "Cheesecake factory is always our comfort restaurant, our go-to when we can&amp;#39;t think of anything else. \u00a0The portions are ginormous, so if you order one appetizer + one entree and share, it&amp;#39;s more than enough for a full meal. \u00a0It also brings your total bill to less than $30, so it&amp;#39;s a relatively inexpensive way to enjoy a good and satisfying meal.<br&gt;<br&gt;Drinks here are mixed, not particularly great, but OKAY. \u00a0Service is also mixed; we&amp;#39;ve had terrible service several times, but not so bad that it made our experience unbearable.<br&gt;<br&gt;All the chicken dishes are GREAT, I&amp;#39;ve had almost every single one. \u00a0Try the BangBang Chicken!! \u00a0OR any of the Italian-prepared dishes! \u00a0Avocado eggrolls are awesome,. \u00a0Best pasta = bistro shrimp. \u00a0The coconut cheesecake tastes like Samoas (Girl Scout Cookies), and their torte is also super good.<br&gt;<br&gt;Clearly I come here too often.", "rating": 4, "date": "10/19/2008"}, {"text": "The best in pasadena people...

I always, always order this with extra sauce on the side because the sauce is delicious &amp;amp; you cannot go wrong with extra sauce. The Pasadena location is the only location that can consistently cook this pasta to perfection which is a make or break on a dish like this. <br&gt;<br&gt;2) Angel hair with shrimp. It&amp;#39;s a simple pasta, probably something I could whip up at home, but the tomatoes at least TASTE fresh &amp;amp; the shrimp &amp;amp; pasta are both perfectly cooked (at all locations). <br&gt;<br&gt;3) Jamaican black pepper shrimp. I was feeling adventurous when I first ordered this one &amp;amp;....it&amp;#39;s a mood thing. It&amp;#39;s not a default order (jambalaya)...you know how you always have that one dish you always feel guilty for ordering ALL THE TIME. The spice is nice, the mango salsa is what you&amp;#39;d expect, &amp;amp; the beans are tolerable (I hate the texture of beans, but these are flavorful enough to make up for it). <br&gt;<br&gt;4) Shrimp scampi. Honestly, no one can mess this dish up, but somehow (Cheesecake Factory, La Brea), you did. Pasadena on the other hand, you have never disappointed me. So one time I was practically swooning over the scampi &amp;amp; my friend is curious, so she has a bite &amp;amp; exclaims, &amp;#34;WHAT THE HELL THAT&amp;#39;S ALL BUTTER?&amp;#34; I gave her a blank look &amp;amp; since then, I&amp;#39;ve questioned our relationship. <br&gt;<br&gt;Although the wait times can get ridiculous at night, if you&amp;#39;re ever going to a Cheesecake Factory, I&amp;#39;d go with this location.

The vision that I discovered was that of a restaurant. It was of one that carried my disappointment, but also found amid that shrouded darkness of that night, a forgiving hand in an executioner. Who was the foggy institution that prodded the inspired vision of my pillow? It was a child&amp;#39;s will that lead the hand of fate and fulfilled my very dream. My daughter Lauren&amp;#39;s birthday had arrived and she confided in me that she was emotionally bond to a single restaurant, The Cheese Cake Factory. \u00a0She maturely penned in my calendar, a lunch date for two. I was worried for the falling sands of the hourglass had taught me that time was fleeting and less then an hour to eat and return Snow White to school was a work of fiction<br&gt;<br&gt;I have no lasting disappointment with CCF, but they have done their utmost to confuse me. Let me place my Dr Phil cap on for a moment, minus the degree (stated for legal reasons); why do people insist on waiting in long lines for adequate but not inspired food selections? It may be the herd mentality; a person swayed by others eagerness, also known as a line. On their behalf, CCF is consistently reliable and steady. They do offer a lunch specials till 5 p.m., most items falling below the ($10) range. \u00a0I tackled the herb crusted fillet of salmon for ($12.95), it was good and reliable. That appears to be a thought this week, reliable food selections. Be prudent in selecting items here as they build confidence in many of their food selections but do stumble in some as well. My daughter Lauren went Paris Hilton on me and ordered the Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta for ($16.95). \u00a0She either tired of the meal or I was very fortunate to firmly secure two very delectable shrimp. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;If you have been to The Cheese Cake Factory you know that they have advertisements inside their menu. It irritates me but is an acceptable reality. What is beginning to bothering me though, and I need to verify produces prices, restaurants are now charging ($9) and above for chips and guacamole, and that includes CCF. They do offer an eclectic array of dishes that calm the beast and nurture the butterfly in any group and it would be false to say that other restaurants risk and attempt to service the limitless cravings of our ethnically diverse Californians. They do get credit for trying and walking the tightrope here. <br&gt;The menu starts off by saying, &amp;#34;The best possible food and service.&amp;#34; The spirit of their motto is felt in the seats and upon every fork of the restaurant!!

But when my friend suggested it, I thought, &amp;#34;why not give it another try?&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;We came the night of the Superbowl, so the place was not ridiculously busy. In fact, it was kind of empty. However, this did not stop our host from making us wait 10-15 minutes while they &amp;#34;fixed our table&amp;#34;. Yeah right.

So both my friends ordered drinks and we started off with avocado egg rolls for appetizer. I remembered how much I liked it at BJ&amp;#39;s and wanted to try their version here. Ehh, BJ&amp;#39;s was definitely way better. Then we ordered our main entrees. I got the Cajun Jambalaya, because I had read on Yelp that a lot of people liked it and it also said on the menu that it was their most popular pasta dish. It was A-Ok. I&amp;#39;m not a big fan. In fact, I only ate about 1/4 of it because the portion was huge. None of my friends finished their food either. I ordered a tropical martini (Absolut vodka with pineapple, mango, and one other fruit) , which I expected to be fruity and fresh. It was a tad on the sweet side, like candy, so I didn&amp;#39;t enjoy it too much. It actually tasted better to me once the ice melted and watered it down. We finished off with tiramisu cheesecake, which I surprisingly liked. I would&amp;#39;ve liked to try their red velvet cheesecake with white chocolate (the actual name escapes me), but I know that I wouldn&amp;#39;t have been able to finish it by myself.
