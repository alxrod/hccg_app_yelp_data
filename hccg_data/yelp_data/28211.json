I ordered the vinaigrette on the side. My mouth waters even now just thinking about it. <br&gt;<br&gt;My wife went with their Tuscan Chicken at $17.95 off of their Skinnylicious Menu and claimed it was one of the most savory dishes she has ever had.

The restaurant was not packed even though that should have nothing to do with the people who are not ordering food. So once I order I stepped to the side to wait. After about 2 to 3 minutes she took my cheesecake out of the display case and sat it one the counter. Then another almost 20 min went by before I was given my order. The elderly couple that was in front of me came back up to counter to inquire about what was taking so long. There are two individuals behind the counter and they are ignoring her. After she tried to get their attention the third time I walked up to counter and asked her what she had. Then I said excuse me to the individuals and asked them what was taking so long with we order (Let me add that the customer that ordered before me but after the elderly couple already got her order a long time ago). The lady behind the counter told me that they have to do the orders for the entire restaurant. I asked her what does that have to do with the people who are not ordering food. She finally gave the elderly couple their order. So I tasked her my order is just sitting there why can&amp;#39;t you just give it to me so I can leave. She replied that they go by the tickets. Then she gave me my order. It makes no sense to me. If someone walks up to the counter to order some thing the is already made and sitting there why can&amp;#39;t they get it and go. All they have to do is put in on a plate and hand it off. There is no reason why they should have to wait all that long time to receive something that is just sitting right there. The other customers are ordering are sitting in the restaurant enjoying themselves. I&amp;#39;m standing and waiting for something that could be taken care of instantly. If there were so many orders as she made it out to seem them the cashier that rung me up should have turned around and put my order on a plate and bag and gave it to me. I would not have minded waiting 2 minutes for her get the customer order in front of me instead of waiting over 15 minutes and having my order just sitting there staring at me while other people are breathing all over it. If you are presented with the opportunity to appease your customers in any way it should be taken. I came from 4 hrs away and I make sure I come by everytime to get some food from your restaurant.

We were sat about 6 inches from another couple and it was like we were sitting with them and we had to sit and listen to them smack and make gross noises while they ate . And we also couldn&amp;#39;t get up til they left .. they had scooted the little table right up to ours and we couldn&amp;#39;t squeeze through the spot... it was awkward and I didn&amp;#39;t enjoy that.

Back at my old job in Virginia I would take clients out to lunch quite often, and where did they always want to go? The Cheesecake Factory. Have gone there so much, I really got to try a variety of different dishes, from the salads, to the pastas, to the steaks, salmon, burgers, sandwiches, etc. I tend to order the louisiana chicken pasta or a steak. Or one of their great salads if it&amp;#39;s lunch time. <br&gt;<br&gt;I was never a fan of restaurants with such an extensive menu, but Cheesecake does a good job. I cannot recall ordering anything that I didn&amp;#39;t like. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I can&amp;#39;t recall ordering a dish and thinking that it was my favorite ever, but Cheesecake is pretty consistent. And their portions are large so you feel like you&amp;#39;re getting your money&amp;#39;s worth. That&amp;#39;s why I think it&amp;#39;s always busy on Weekends for lunch and dinner. There really is a lot to choose from, which is good when you have a group of people that can&amp;#39;t decide on cuisine that night. <br&gt;<br&gt;The service isn&amp;#39;t bad. I think that people in general need to understand that when a restaurant is super busy sometimes the level of service dips a little bit. And not all server is created equal. In every restaurant there are servers who move more efficiently, make few mistakes, and...well...for a lack of a more eloquent way to put it...are just better than others. And unless you&amp;#39;re a regular you probably won&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s who. Having waited tables in the past I probably tend to have more patience with service. That being said I&amp;#39;ve had great service on weekends and off-peak hours here than I did on the weekend dinners that were had here. coincidence? I doubt it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Not much needs to be said about the cheesecake.

My granddaughter wanted to celebrate her boyfriend&amp;#39;s \u00a0birthday along with mine and 2 others family members with birthdays next week. 10 of us met at south park at 3 in the afternoon. My granddaughter told the hostess how many and was told it would be 1 to 2 hour wait and given a beeper. We decided to walk around the mall and thought it surly will not be 2 hours. At 2 1/2 hrs we checked and were told it would be another 1 to 2 hours. At this point you think oh heck no, but you have already waited so you continue to wait. At 6:20 after many more checking with the hostess our beeper went off. We were seated at a table for 8, not 10. They then get 2 more chairs and look upset that it was required. Our waitress comes over takes drink orders and my husband orders a mix drink while everyone else orders tea or soda and one young man with us under 21 says jokingly I will take one of what he is having and his mom says no he will not he is underage. When she returns she gives him a mix drink and never asked for ID. My husband drank it after drinking his because he did not want to get her in trouble. She comes back and asks if the young man (18 yrs) with us would like another and we all say no. We waited for our meal for over an hour. When it came out the young man that was served alcohol had no meal. It took another 30 minutes for his to be served. The food was not great, the Steak was tough, black beans were hard and overall taste not good. Then she said they were busy so if we wanted dessert we needed to let her know because it would a while for it to be served. It is the Cheesecake Factory, so yes we wanted dessert. Half ordered desserts to go and half to eat there. They brought out the to go order and then 15 minutes later they bring the other desserts. The to go orders were literally half of the size of the ones served at our table.

I have tried numerous appetizers, pasta entree, burger entree, and cheesecake desserts. Overall, the flavor of the food is great, the presentation is also commendable and the portion is very large. Because of the large portion, on some of their dishes they offer 1/2 sizes. The interior decoration is very nice, 2 floor high ceiling, golden deco, very spacious and many different sections. They have a full bar overlooking a great view. When you order pasta, they always bring out parmasan and shred it right in front of you. Love their pesto and sundries tomatoes. They also always bring put a basket of wheat and white bread after you order. Entrees range around 12-18 dollar. Appetizers around $8-12. Their appetizers are pretty big too, i ordered the avocado spring rolls once and i was able to eat it as an entree. The avocado spring rolls are amazing, i highly recommend them. They are different than any other spring rolls you&amp;#39;ve had. Perfect flavor and consistency over a crispy shell. If i remembered correctly, there are 6 large half pieces of spring rolls.

I personally had a horrible experience that was compounded by a lot of excuses. We drove over hour to this location. I attempted to order the tater tots but 5-10 minutes later the waitress Katherine B came back with a menu as i was informed that the tater tots are all gone!! Okay..I was not happy with this as this is the only thing I wanted. I did not order anything else off of the menu and was still upset that there lack of preparation resulted in me not getting a basic menu item. After about 10 minutes i talked to the waitress again and asked to speak to the manager.She informed me that she had spoken to the manager Brian and that he would be over to talk to me. My issue is why did i have to go find the waitress and ask for the manager. The manager should have been to our table earlier after she reported the issue to start with. I don&amp;#39;t know if she reported to issue from the start or only after i asked to see the manager. Once i asked for the manager he arrived within a couple of minutes. I explained that i was not happy at all that a listed menu item was not available. I informed him that we come all the the time and have never been told that a item on the menu was not available. He then stated in a very cocky and unconcerned tone that we run out of items everyday! Wow! Well we have been coming for years and this never happened before. I then said well shouldn&amp;#39;t the staff know there are items not available before a customer orders. &amp;#34;We have over 200 plus items on the menu we can inform them on everything&amp;#34; I understand i was upset but when he walked away my daughter ands my wife said that he was very arrogant and unconcerned about the issue. It felt as if he thought that i wanted something free or a discount for my wife and daughters food. He was not concerned in anyway shape or form. He just made a excuse for anything that i said. As a manager you should order the inventory and supplies needed to take care of your customers. If you make a mistake as a manager then own it and not make excuse after excuse as Brian&amp;#34;The Manager&amp;#34; did several times. Do i think there was another huge factor in the way i was treated? Absolutely!Its 2018 and I would think that my money and business is just as important as any other customer. Minority customers should be treated with the same respect as everyone else. This is not what we experienced today at the cheesecake factory and from Brian the manager. As i mentioned before i was bothered by his responses but when my wife and my daughter both agree that he was rude and not concerned about my issue then it&amp;#39;s pretty much true. As a customer it&amp;#39;s not my concern on when supplies and etc come in. As a manager you should have the skills and ability to accurately order supplies to take care of your customers and allow them to order what you have listed on the items.

I have eaten here many times and I try to get something different every time I go and I have not been disappointed. The crusted chicken romano is a must, so is the stuffed chicken marsala. For some reason, when I&amp;#39;ve had a dish with marsala sauce, it seems over powering with the wine, but not at Cheesecake Factory. They get it just right to where you can taste the mushrooms and other flavors with your meal. Their garlic mashed potatoes are to die for! They use red potatoes instead of russet or yellow potatoes. The texture is a little lumpy, yet smooth all at the same time. <br&gt;<br&gt;Let&amp;#39;s not forget their cheesecake. That&amp;#39;s the reason why you came right? There are 2 pages of cheesecake selections in the menu. All of their cheesecake is wonderful, but make sure you have a glass of water or milk handy because most of their cheesecakes are RICH! They range from your traditional cheesecake with strawberries to a carrot cake cheesecake. If you&amp;#39;re a peanut butter fan like myself, fear not, they have about 3 different kind of cheesecake with peanut butter. Let&amp;#39;s not forget their carrot cake!! The 1st time I had their carrot cake was at Barnes &amp;amp; Nobles and it was like my mom used to make. Dreamy!<br&gt;<br&gt;As for the wait, be prepared to wait 15-30 minutes on the weekend at least and during the week about 10-15 minutes to get seated. Never have I gone to the restaurant and gotten seated immediately. It&amp;#39;s well worth the wait and what better way to wait at the bar? I&amp;#39;m a Long Island kind of girl, but I have had their cranberry and vodka. Their liquor is all top shelf and I always had a well mixed drink, nothing overpowering in 1 liquor. <br&gt;<br&gt;The wait staff is knowledgeable and very polite. I&amp;#39;ve had only 1 server that was pretty bad, but that was because we were his last table and we were taking our sweet time. Yes, it&amp;#39;s still not an excuse to be rude and try to rush people out, but overall, I haven&amp;#39;t had really bad service.<br&gt;<br&gt;Cons: <br&gt;Long wait to be seated.<br&gt;Noise, sometimes can&amp;#39;t hear what your company is saying to you across the table from you.<br&gt;Little tables.", "rating": 4, "date": "7/21/2009"}, {"text": "I wish I could have the team who designs the inside of these restaurants design my house. \u00a0Between the &amp;#39;Factory in Chicago and the one in Charlotte, they&amp;#39;re probably some of the prettiest places to eat. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;The food? \u00a0It&amp;#39;s good. \u00a0I&amp;#39;ve never had the issues the other reviewers are calling the &amp;#34;6 o&amp;#39;clock sweats&amp;#34;. \u00a0But the food here does seem to have some quality that leaves me feeling completely saturated. \u00a0Maybe it&amp;#39;s one of those places that makes your eyes fall out of your head when you see the nutritional facts on their food. \u00a0<br&gt;Whatever the case, the menu is pretty diverse. \u00a0I&amp;#39;ve eaten about a dozen times split between the two &amp;#39;Factory restaurants I&amp;#39;ve visited and only been disappointed once. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;Their cheesecake is pretty unique. \u00a0I can down a slice of cheesecake in a sitting pretty easily, but the cake from here takes me at least 3 attempts to finish it. \u00a0But that&amp;#39;s a good thing. \u00a0It packs all the flavor (and calories, I&amp;#39;m sure) of 3 slices of your typical cheesecake into one slice. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;The service has always been very good, even when it&amp;#39;s packed, (which is often.)<br&gt;Their beer list is usually pretty decent. \u00a0They usually have the typical summer wheat, a couple lagers, a dark and one or two &amp;#34;local&amp;#34; brews, (for Charlotte, that means Yuengling. \u00a0Chicago was Goose Island.) \u00a0Nothing extravagant, but their beer selection does a good job of matching the light, stylish mood of the restaurant.<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s pricey, but I don&amp;#39;t come here when I&amp;#39;m searching for a good value. \u00a0I come when I&amp;#39;m looking for a reliable menu and a lot of atmosphere. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve never been, you really do need to try it. \u00a0For the cheesecake if nothing else.", "rating": 4, "date": "3/27/2009"}, {"text": "The service was great; our server called us &amp;#39;princess&amp;#39; which was cute.

Just wanted to help save most people from a disappointment.", "rating": 4, "date": "10/7/2012"}, {"text": "Went right at lunch time on Sat, they said a 15 min. wait, I looked around and thought--no way, too many people, but our kids had never been so we decided to wait it out. \u00a0We were called 15 mins exactly. \u00a0I had the chicken salad sandwich, I am extremely picky about chicken salad. \u00a0It was good, I ate most of it, but it wasn&amp;#39;t exceptional, but to make up for that it was a huge portion and they did not skimp on the quantity of white chicken meat. \u00a0The fries were just fries, I think I ate 2. \u00a0They did mess up our son&amp;#39;s order: \u00a0soft tacos with only meat and cheese, everything else on the side. \u00a0When they arrived with thinly shredded lettuce throughout the tacos, our waiter pretty much suggested we pull them out. You CANNOT pull out shredded lettuce from a taco... \u00a0He did take them back but it took a very long time to replace. \u00a0The quality of the taco meat was good though, not the normal ground generic beef. \u00a0The mixed drinks looked good, but my husband and I just had a draft beer (only 3 or 4 to choose from, but good choices) bc we were getting ready to spend ALL day shopping in the South Park mall. \u00a0 I don&amp;#39;t mind spending money for exceptional food, but I thought this was just a little over priced for the quality and service. \u00a0We would probly go back, but mainly bc the kids loved it so much, not for the quality of the food or value.", "rating": 3, "date": "4/3/2013"}, {"text": "I went with my sister for lunch on a Saturday. \u00a0We got there about 10 minutes after they opened so we didn&amp;#39;t have the wait other people have complianed about. \u00a0They seated us at a two top bench seat in the bar area. At first this seemed fine but 10 \u00a0minutes later the hostess started setting up the table next to us (the tables were about 12 inches apart) with 2 highchairs and a booster seat then seated 2 couples with 3 small children. They were not happy being squeezed into a bench seat with the highchairs etc. but even after they complained to the waitress and the hostess, the hostess seemed unable to come up with a solution. \u00a0Seems they could have just moved them to a table where they could move the chairs to accomodate the highchairs. \u00a0The menu is overwhelming. \u00a0I&amp;#39;m always a little suspicious of a menu with so many items. \u00a0I feel like more often than not, everything just ends up being okay and nothing is really good. \u00a0My sister ended up getting the burrito and I got the bbq chicken salad. \u00a0The burrito was the biggest portion of food I&amp;#39;ve ever seen in a restaurant. \u00a0It could have easily fed 4 adults. \u00a0I could only eat about 1/3 of the salad and it was the lunch portion. \u00a0The food was good, not great. \u00a0The service was good. \u00a0I would go again but would request a table, not a bench seat.", "rating": 3, "date": "1/23/2011"}]}
