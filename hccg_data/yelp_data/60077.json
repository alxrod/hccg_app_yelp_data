We ordered (for pick up) shrimp scampi pasta, farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic and the cajun jambalya pasta. The cajun jambalaya had a good flavor but everything was greasy. They changed the shrimp scampi pasta recipe (I called the restaurant to see if they changed the recipe and they indicated they did) and the sauce no longer has the roasted garlic. This dish also lacked any flavor and was greasy (buttery). The farfalle (which used to be one of my favorites) recipe also changed. There was no roasted garlic but carmelized onions. One would think this gave the recipe flavor but did not at all. The farfalle pasta was soooooo buttery and greasy and had no flavor at all. Just a butter taste. All 3 of our pastas had the same theme: Super greasy and buttery. Tonight is the last night we are getting food from Cheesecake Factory.

We were seated right away in a back table as all the booths were already taken. We had a drink each, a margarita served in a martini glass and a frozen peach drink that tasted more like orange than peach. We got the fried avocado appetizer, which is tasty, but overpriced for the amount of food served. It took them forever to bring the appetizer, so we stuffed ourselves with the bread. Finally our main dishes came. It was the bistro shrimp pasta and the eggplant parmesan.<br&gt;The bistro shrimp pasta was very garlicky and my eggplant parmesan tasted like mozzarella sticks. It had mostly cheese and barely any eggplant. I guess they just want it to taste good so they stuff it with 90% cheese. I was disappointed by this. If I wanted mozzarella sticks I wouldn&amp;#39;t have ordered eggplant parmesan, but asked for mozzarella sticks instead.<br&gt;Portion size is huge and we took leftovers to go.<br&gt;On our way out, we did buy a slice of cheesecake each (tiramisu &amp;amp; hazelnut one). We wanted to try it and see if it lives up to the chain&amp;#39;s name. At this time the place was a crazy house. There was a huge line for the cheesecake and take out orders. The hostess stand was surrounded by hungry irritated folks waiting for a table. There was yelling, shoving, etc in the upstairs foyer area. A complete mess! I dont understand why they dont use the entire first floor? Also the restroom is tiny and dirty!<br&gt;To top it all off later that evening we felt so heavy and our stomachs were upset from the food we ate. It was way too greasy and fat. I think they make everything in butter and I never cook with butter, but rather a bit of olive oil or canola oil. This was so greasy that it was making our stomachs go crazy.<br&gt;I will give them the two stars for the cheesecake. It was really good and the only thing that I would step in here for again.

The manager was rude and implied that the fly &amp;#34;had JUST flown into my drink&amp;#34; when it had clearly been served with the fly. He did not apologize or even offer to replace my drink.

This ends up being our default restaurant to order from when doing family dinners at home, though we order from the Lincolnshire location since it&amp;#39;s closer. I recently dined here, and have to say that I like this location a whole lot more. Mainly two reasons why I like it more, since the quality and taste of the food is primarily the same. This location doesn&amp;#39;t have the &amp;#34;Lincolnshire vibe&amp;#34; (I am sure some know what I am referring to when I say that) and I the interior is so beautiful and a lot more spacious. I haven&amp;#39;t been to any other locations, so I am just judging between these two. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food - LOVE both the dark and white bread that they give out, esp with butter. Mmm so good, but it fills you up before the real food is served! My favorite dish is the Chicken Madeira which is under their specialties. It&amp;#39;s pricey, but it&amp;#39;s a HUGE portion and the melted mozzarella cheese on the chicken is absolutely incredible. I&amp;#39;ve tried three or four of the salads, all are great! Basically, I&amp;#39;ve never experienced anything bad, nor has any of the people I&amp;#39;ve dined with. I try to stay away from the cheesecake, but I can admit to having tried it just a couple times and it&amp;#39;s always unbelievably good and bad at the same time... can&amp;#39;t even imagine how many calories are in once slice! The two I&amp;#39;ve tried are the red velvet and pumpkin - can&amp;#39;t go wrong with those two flavors...

I tried it for the first time around 6 years ago and I couldn&amp;#39;t believe what I had been missing. I am such a fan. <br&gt;Important points:<br&gt;1) This is a GREAT place for pasta lovers. Seriously, you don&amp;#39;t know what you are missing. ~(The shining star dish is the Louisiana Pasta, which is divine. Crispy breaded chicken on top, bow-tie pasta with a spicy Cajun sauce and small bits of mushrooms and red peppers. They must put some type of drug in this dish because it is that addictive. Also, the Farfalle pasta is to die for. Bow-tie pasta in a roasted garlic-Parmesan cream sauce with a medley of peas, caramelized onions, tomatoes, and tender chicken pieces. My boyfriend and I always have a deeply internal conflict with choosing one over the other, haha. We always end up getting one for him and the other for myself, and then sharing them both. They are both that good. The Evelyn&amp;#39;s pasta is also delicious (penne with broccoli, dried tomatoes, roasted eggplant, peppers, artichoke, Kalamata olives, garlic and pine nuts.) My mom is obsessed with that one.)~<br&gt;2) The portions are ENORMOUS. I am a distance runner and have the appetite of a horse, and twice I have made it my goal to finish my entree, but have yet to make it happen. Maybe because I pig out on so much bread beforehand? Also, the pasta tastes just as amazing the next day!<br&gt;3) Going off of the second point, the bread is AMAZING! You get both sour dough and pumpernickel. It is so fresh and soft that it just melts in your mouth. The bread is almost as exciting as the meal itself. Also, they bring you as much as you want. The only thing I always find irritating is how difficult the butter is to spread because they take it straight from a fridge, but no complaints. <br&gt;4) I know that I probably do not need to emphasize this...but the cheesecake is heaven on earth. I love cheesecake and this is the place to get it. I have tried so many different flavors, but my favorite is definitely the red velvet. It is enormous and so rich and delicious. The Godiva cheesecake is so deep and rich, great for lovers of rich cocoa. The oreo cheesecake is great, Reese&amp;#39;s peanut butter cheesecake is amazing and huge, dulce de leche is smooth and creamy, banana cheesecake is heavenly. Can you tell I have been here a few times? Haha. <br&gt;5) The prices at this restaurant make it somewhere to go more for a special occasion. I go here for birthdays (which they have always made special by decorating a plate with strawberry sauce and adorning it with a massive slice of cheesecake 0:]), graduations, anniversaries, that type of thing. Definitely not your casual, Friday night type of budget. When my boyfriend and I go, we get two entrees and a dessert to share (and sometimes a soda), and it is always right around $50. So totally worth it. <br&gt;6) The food is ALWAYS a hit, but it is true that the service can SOMETIMES be a miss. We have definitely had more good experiences than bad, but if you do get a slow server (won&amp;#39;t bring out the bread right when you get there), just ask for it. It has never been a big deal. The staff has always been friendly to us, and never slow enough to be aggravating. <br&gt;*I think it is important to warn that I do not recommend this restaurant for much besides the pasta. The prices just do not justify their other options, in my opinion. My brother felt like being a king, so he ordered the $25 steak, and was not impressed. I am not a steak lover, but do admit that thing was tiny for what he paid. He received a side of fries with it. Just not worth 25 dollars. Go to Longhorn for that. For pasta though, I insist, you will not find better pasta in bigger portions anywhere else. Best place ever. I have also heard rave reviews about their fried mac n cheese, but have never tried it myself. I love this place! Please give it a try on your special day!

Prior to going here I went on-line to look at their nutritional menu. I was shocked how much sodium is in nearly every dish. I mean well over 800, and some dishes have over 1,000 or over 1,500 mg of sodium. I ordered from their Skinny-licious section, where items are under 500 calories. I had the Skinnylicious grilled turkey burger, and scraped off all the condiments on the burger. I didn&amp;#39;t eat the bun either. The grilled turkey burger was seasoned nicely. It was moist and tender and perfectly cook. However, the black pepper overpowered the burger. For this reason, 3-stars. BTW, my turkey burger came with a small side salad with a variety of greens (no tomato, no cucumbers, nothing else) Basically, a plain and boring salad that was very, very soggy. I didn&amp;#39;t eat the salad. However, if you order their &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; Turkey Burger you will inhale 1,370 calories and 1,630 mg of sodium (salt). Definitely not a healthy choice!<br&gt;<br&gt;On the other hand, my husband ordered a double burger which was huge and a mess to eat. It was topped off with four crispy onion rings, loaded with caramelized onions, bacon, cheese and bar-b-q sauce. He said he really liked his burger and rated it with 4-stars. His burger was 1,580 calories and contained 2,990 mg of sodium. Wow, a heart attack waiting to happen! His burger came with fries. He shared a few with me, which were very good. We ended up ordering an extra side of fries without salt. The fries were the highlight of my meal. <br&gt;<br&gt;We also ordered chicken samosas as our appetizer. Four were served, and they were very, very small and bland. The exterior was crispy, light and flaky. These samosas were served with a dipping sauce. I tasted the creamy white dipping sauce sprinkled with some tiny green specks. It was incredibly bland, and another disappointment. I was expecting these samosas to be similar to the ones we have eaten at Indian restaurants. They were not. <br&gt;<br&gt;Here is what I walked away with when I counted 166 items on the menu with over 1,000 calories (not a typo) that made me think it must be a very unhealthy restaurant to eat. Too many calories, too much fat, too much refined carbs, too much sodium (salt). <br&gt;<br&gt;The restaurant was not crowded or super busy considering it was Saturday. We went up the stairs to the second level and were seated immediately near large glass windows. Service was painfully slow. Our water glasses were left empty twice, so we had to keep asking our server for water (otherwise, we never would have gotten a refill on our water glasses). My husband ordered an Apple Crisp to go. I don&amp;#39;t eat sweets, so no dessert for me. He said it was &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; but nothing spectacular. <br&gt;<br&gt;This restaurant reminded me of the Rain Forest Cafe, because it is like a gimmick. The interior was gaudy and ornate.

The wait here is usually pretty long, though not as bad as the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove in Los Angeles that I also frequent. They almost always make up for it with good service once you&amp;#39;re seated, though. They have a huge menu with a wide variety of dishes. I have go-to dishes for every category, depending on my mood:<br&gt;<br&gt;Appetizer - My favourites are the tex mex eggrolls and the thai chicken lettuce wraps. I wouldn&amp;#39;t say the text mex eggrolls are worth the price, but they&amp;#39;re SO good. And the thai chicken lettuce wraps come in an enormous plate -- definitely enough for a meal.<br&gt;<br&gt;Soup - Clam chowder! Their clam chowder is so chunky and creamy; I love it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Salad - BBQ chicken salad. Huge portions and really tasty, though there usually isn&amp;#39;t that much chicken. I haven&amp;#39;t tried any of the other salads, but they all sound really good.<br&gt;<br&gt;Pizza - BBQ chicken pizza. It&amp;#39;s the only one I&amp;#39;ve ever tried, and I like it enough to stick with it. I wouldn&amp;#39;t order the pizza here, though -- it&amp;#39;s good, but there are better dishes on the menu.<br&gt;<br&gt;Seafood - Miso salmon. Honestly, you can&amp;#39;t go wrong with this dish in any restaurant, but it&amp;#39;s especially good here. My only qualm is that it&amp;#39;s fairly expensive at $19.95.<br&gt;<br&gt;Pasta - Honestly, I&amp;#39;ve tried almost every pasta dish on their menu, and I don&amp;#39;t really like any of them. They&amp;#39;re all decent, but I can never finish more than half a dish. The Louisiana chicken pasta is probably my favourite, though the spicy chicken cajun pasta is also good if they don&amp;#39;t make it too sweet as they tend to do.<br&gt;<br&gt;Specialties - The Cajun chicken littles are amazing when they&amp;#39;re well done. Even if the chicken is dry or burnt, though, it&amp;#39;s worth ordering the dish for the mashed potatoes alone. Mmm. The Shepherd&amp;#39;s Pie (ground beef, carrots, peas, and onions topped with mashed potatoes) is my absolute favourite dish. If you make it here in time for lunch, order this -- it&amp;#39;s only $9.95, and it&amp;#39;s big enough that you&amp;#39;ll bring home leftovers. Just ask them for minimal oil, otherwise it&amp;#39;ll be swimming in grease. My most recent discovery is the shrimp and chicken gumbo. They&amp;#39;re really generous with the meat, and the sauce is well seasoned. I find that it doesn&amp;#39;t keep well in the fridge, though, so try not to bring home leftovers if you order that.<br&gt;<br&gt;As for the cheesecake part... well, surprisingly, I&amp;#39;ve only tried one of their cheesecakes (white chocolate raspberry) and I wasn&amp;#39;t impressed.

I like food that&amp;#39;s hearty, tasty, hot and satisfying, and for me, all those chicken dishes on the menu don&amp;#39;t quite hit the spot like a juicy piece of steak or fish--both of which were cooked perfectly--tender, juicy and tasty, with lovely sauces and mashed potatoes just the way I like em - a mix of rustic &amp;amp; creamy texture. I started off making a pig of myself with a bowl of rich/dark mushroom soup (there was something of a witch&amp;#39;s brew of tasty veg &amp;amp; seasonings in there that did it no harm at all--yum), and some warm/crispy french bread. We don&amp;#39;t go here a lot (it&amp;#39;s become more of an occasional treat than something like a routine), but it&amp;#39;s one that I have continued to look forward to (clearly others feel the same way, judging by the 15-20 minute wait, but the minutes trip by quite nicely when you spend it looking through the menu and browsing the cheesecake counter). I think the point is that there are very few places locally that offer that kind of value, and also come with nice service, easy parking, a location near home, and a relatively short wait (15-minutes). \u00a0Risking a post-meal heart attack, we shared a big slab of lemon meringue cheesecake too (not the lightest choice in the huge cheesecake selection, but very satisfying!). I must admit that one previous occasion, the salmon was a bit more &amp;#39;done&amp;#39; than I&amp;#39;d like, but tonight, everything came together (except for self control), and I feel like a happy king after a banquet.

Of course, they&amp;#39;re well known for their cheesecake, and the selections are good enough. I would rather stop here for an afternoon cheesecake and ice-cream treat rather than for a full meal.<br&gt;<br&gt;The service is less than average, even though it&amp;#39;s not too bad. You will have to wait for quite a bit to be served and the servers tend to forget special requests. For example, I often ask for no onion, less fat etc.., but they forgot half of the time. Sometimes they are nice enough to replace it, sometimes they just apologize and hope that you&amp;#39;re ok with it.

It is a really nice space here, pretty classy. The pleasantries end there, I sat and waited for over 10 minutes for a server , we were just about to leave when she finally showed up. The older lady next to us had it alot worse , I&amp;#39;ll get to her later. I ordered the salmon over spinach , and the Crab Wontons. The wife ordered the Fettichini chicken and the kid ordered the pepperoni pizza. Then we waited ... and waited ... and waited , 15 minutes in all for the appetizers. \u00a0The poor lady next to us was sitting there when we were seated , and she was sitting there with an empty place setting when we got our appetizers. She finally got her soup about 5 minutes into out wontons. We then proceeded to wait for our entrees , for 25 minutes after our wantons were long gone , 30 minutes in all. The poor woman next to us finally got her sandwich after sitting with an empty soup bowl for 20 minutes as well. The place was full , but not packed to the gills like the wait would lead us to believe. My wife said the chicken she got was &amp;#34;alright&amp;#34; but I could tell she was still really pissed at all the waiting. I actually really enjoyed everything I ate , I gotta admit. While we ate , the woman time forgot finally got her food , and finished it. She called for the manager and the manager calmly explained that they &amp;#34;were just really busy&amp;#34; and offered to give her a certificate for a free appetizer ... what a dick. I finished my food and proceeded to wait for the check for another 10 minutes. I contemplated getting dessert , but by the time the server finally got there I was sick of being there. The prices were really high for what we got , I&amp;#39;ve payed much less for better. \u00a0I usually judge restaurants 80% to 90% on the food , putting much less value on service , ambiance and cost.

The waiters here are alright, theres one waiter who thinks hes gods gift and that hes a model, he may be cute but he was rude and had no sense of humor, just took our order and left, didnt try to make a conversation with us at all. When we first sat down he didn&amp;#39;t even give us bread, not till we ordered, my friend then ask if we could have bread and he just took it from another empty table and gave it to us and quickly left to put in our orders, so we had to ask another waiter for the butter. We got our food and ate, he ask us if we wanted dessert and we ask him which cheesecake is supposedly the best, his respond &amp;#34;there all pretty good, just try one.&amp;#34; last time i ask a waiter which is the supposedly the best one he pointed to me the Godiva cheesecake (super chocolaty but great), this waiter didnt care what we order as long as we order something, he seem kind of in a rush also. over all its an a-okay place. sometimes its nice and sometimes its not. ehhhh.", "rating": 3, "date": "1/20/2011"}]}
