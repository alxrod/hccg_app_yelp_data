Apparently many patrons would put their name down, get handed a pager, would walk around and then decide not to wait leaving the pager whereever they were last. Because of this, they decided to go to a texting system where you leave your phone number and get a text when your table is ready. <br&gt;<br&gt;There is balcony seating, which has been recently renovated to include booths that overlook the balcony...dinner with a view!

He said the restaurant would text me once my food was ready. I said okay, and that was about 45 mins after I placed my relatively small order that was supposed to be ready in 30 mins.

The food is good, and most of the time the service is great. However this time I was extremely disappointed to the point where I will not go back to this location simply based on the abysmal service JUST with trying to get an accommodation for seating. Myself and my best friend&amp;#39;s Mother attempted to get reservations for my best friend&amp;#39;s Birthday, and were immediately told over the phone that they do not accommodate reservations for over six people. Ok, as much as I don&amp;#39;t understand this I went with it. Upon telling my best friend&amp;#39;s mother this, she called in to speak to the manager to see if there was a way that we could get around this as we had a party of 11 people coming. She spoke with the manager, and we ended up putting in two reservations online back to back so we would all be able to sit together. Excellent! Now we are all set for the Birthday dinner! When we arrived there, we were greeted with nothing but difficulty from the front desk. We were told that there was only one reservation online that was showing up, and that the other one wasn&amp;#39;t there even though it had been submitted and confirmed. They even had it documented in their system that the manager had been spoken with. Unfortunately the manager told the front desk he would &amp;#34;be right there&amp;#34; to discuss, but we never spoke to him. The best part of this situation is that the gentleman at the front desk said &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t care who&amp;#39;s birthday it is&amp;#34;, and that we would have to wait around two hours in order to get two tables next to each other. Once we told them that we were going to go elsewhere, shockingly enough they told us that they had two tables that had opened up next to each other. Upon looking - two booths back to back. Listen, I get it because I&amp;#39;ve worked in the service industry and about 99% of the time I am understanding especially on busy nights, but to be greeted with that kind of hostility is really unnecessary especially on somebody&amp;#39;s birthday night. I would expect more given that there were reservations on file, and documentation that someone who worked at the restaurant had been spoken with. Needless to say, we ended up having a wonderful birthday dinner at Maggiano&amp;#39;s who were able to take us in immediately without a holier than thou snap-back.

It was a 25 minute wait for a table of two and we considered and later regretted just not walking one block to the Farmer&amp;#39;s Market at The Grove. <br&gt;<br&gt;My first impression of this place is that it&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;like a theme park restaurant&amp;#34; - and my friend pointed out how a line on the escalator to the second floor looked like people were in fact on a ride. Macaroni Grill is comparable food wise but just does such a much better job with food and ambience. After 25 minutes of waiting people ride the escalator to wait 10-15 more minutes. <br&gt;<br&gt;The low ratings is primarily due to the drink menu coupled with the greasiness of the tables and floors. I felt like I was eating somewhere in Chinatown where at least it&amp;#39;s remotely acceptable and part of the atmosphere. But the light brown tables really brought out the greasy look. Walking to the restroom was greasy. I was wearing mule flats with a reliable bottom tread and the floor was greasy enough to make the trip to the restroom a bit precarious in terms of slippage potential and felt my step slide at least twice. I hate greasy places. The &amp;#34;blood orange margarita&amp;#34; was a joke that went unfinished. Wrong taste, wrong glass. Avoid their cocktails at all costs and just go for draft beer or wine. <br&gt;<br&gt;Their food was the only good thing - their infamous brown bread and butter.

That&amp;#39;s really the only interesting thing about this place. I compare it to McDonald&amp;#39;s and use the same term: &amp;#34;eatability.&amp;#34; The food has high eatability - you can eat a lot of their huge portions before being sated and even when sated want to eat just a bit more. It isn&amp;#39;t necessarily the best food by all standards but boy is it so...eatable. And I don&amp;#39;t mean edible...eatable foods are foods that create their own standard rather than adhere to traditional standards and emphasize the most base human cravings and turn those up a notch. The balance of color, of ingredients, of texture, of ease of transporting food from plate to mouth and the art of shape/portioning - it is all down to a measured science and I gotta say that in itself is pretty respectable and fascinating.

I will definitely still give their food some love but I had to update this review solely so their management will know and hopefully be mindful of it moving forward. <br&gt;<br&gt;I have never had the shepherds pie at cheesecake and wanted to try it. I ordered thru door dash and it arrived looking fine...a lil oily and not a lot of gravy but I was fine with that. The vegetables were nicely cooked and although it all tasted a tiny bit bland it was still pretty good to me. As I continued to eat it I felt more and more like the taste was off...and almost as if It was leaving weird taste or coating in my mouth the more bites I took. I decided to stop eating it and put it aside. Didn&amp;#39;t think too much of it all, but 15mins later my stomach began to get very upset and my lower back started cramping alil. I grabbed the plate...opened up one of the several big chunks of ground meat in the dish and saw right away that it was extremely raw (See Photo Included). I usually like my meat medium rare to medium but this isn&amp;#39;t a steak...this is ground beef...and the majority of it was very raw inside. I was going to look past it it all...but now an additional 30mins later my stomach won&amp;#39;t stop gurgling and I keep having to use the restroom. <br&gt;<br&gt;Look I know we are all human and have off nights...but it&amp;#39;s not ok to give someone food that could possibly make them ill...and I&amp;#39;m sure with ground beef it&amp;#39;s hard to tell...but I hope you will help me out and let the kitchen know it happened so they&amp;#39;ll just be more careful next time and maybe cook this dish the extra couple minutes extra it needs to save customers like me the grief. I know you have great staff and I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed my visits before which is why I&amp;#39;m being extremely understanding about all this, even despite how sick i&amp;#39;m feeling right now. <br&gt;<br&gt;.********** .********** .********** .********** .*********<br&gt;(ORIGINAL REVIEW) <br&gt;One of our favorite happy hour spots! Not that their regular menu isn&amp;#39;t fantastic but we stick to the happy hour because we love hanging out at the bar and the portions are so humungous on the regular menu...the happy hour appetizers are the perfect size for me and my boy to get three different options and share. Tonight warranted a top notch review however because our bartender Taylor was beyond amazing. She was super attentive, offered amazing suggestion and made us two of the best Skinny Long Islands we&amp;#39;d ever had. We ordered the Buffalo Blast, Tex Mex Eggrolls and the Spring Rolls. All of which looked so good that it wasn&amp;#39;t until we had demolished them that I realized I hadn&amp;#39;t taken pictures of them in their pre-eaten Instagram modelesque state...when I&amp;#39;m hungry and the food looks amazing my elite yelp status falls by the wayside. My stomach always wins! The buffalo blast is breaded but not hand wiping greasy and you get a beyond generous portion for the $5.95 price along with some celery sticks (as if to make us feel better for the fried goodness debauchery) along side ramekins of hearty blue cheese dressing and buffalo sauce to dip them in. The Tex mex rolls were the perfect combo of spicy shredded chicken, corn, cheese and Mexican filling accompanied by a creamy cilantro ranch like cream sauce and fresh tomato Pico to top it with, all wrapped in a crispy not greasy fried egg roll wrapping. The spring rolls are a happy hour staple with huge pieces of plump shrimp and rice noodles along side their peanut sauce which is to die for. Pair that with the above and beyond service of a bartender like Taylor and you have a recipe for the best happy hour experience you&amp;#39;ll ever have. Four skinny long islands, complimentary bread, three appetizers, a vodka soda and a house tequila neat we were sitting with a $58 dollar tab that warranted nothing more than a beyond 20% tip and this glowing yelp review. TIP: if you have a smile on your face the grove theater will let you validate your parking so you can stay two hours and pay $2.50 for parking...all depending on your smile and demeanor of course.

Not to mention, their cheesecake is incredible (10/10 would recommend the Red Velvet). <br&gt;One thing about this location is it is always packed so you&amp;#39;ll usually always end up waiting at least 15 minutes for a seat, and on top of that service tends to be a little slow (but they try their best). If you have a lot of time on your hands, and you&amp;#39;re looking for a place to hang out with friends, this is the place to be, but if you&amp;#39;re in a rush, I would definitely go with somewhere a little quicker. <br&gt;Side note, if you&amp;#39;re a sucker for table bread, you&amp;#39;ll LOVE theirs.

She was feeding the dog, dog food. So that smell was in the air. And it&amp;#39;s just not something I want to smell or deal with while eating a delicious plate of Alfredo with shrimp.

With the same look and feel of other locations elsewhere, it&amp;#39;s a great setting with a couple differences. They do have a patio with what I suspect to be a nice view. When you enter there&amp;#39;s a host stand with several hosts, and they&amp;#39;ll take your name down and present you with a pager (if you have to wait). The cool thing is that the pager allows you to walk to a certain distance, so ask about how far it reaches the surrounding area. Once entering you&amp;#39;ll head up a set of stairs or escalators and then you need to talk to another set of hosts who then ultimately seat you. Nearby is a display with desserts and dressings for sale. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service was pretty great by newcomer(at the time) Asia when I visited last and besides one bump in the road with hosts prior to sitting down, everything else went well. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Grove has parking and it&amp;#39;s in a large parking structure. Make to sure to ask about validation as they validate an hour here (first at The Grove is free). <br&gt;<br&gt;--Food, Drinks &amp;amp; Prices---<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure you know what they provide here and at the many other locations; the menu is vast with all sorts of things. Many appetizers, small plates, pasta dishes, pizzas, burgers and sandwiches, soups and salads, tacos, chicken and steak dishes, seafood, and all other sorts of entrees, ranging and hitting many flavors of different cuisines. Portions are large and same with the calories in everything (don&amp;#39;t look!).<br&gt;<br&gt;Love the fresh bread and butter they serve first.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve pretty much loved everything I&amp;#39;ve had at the Factory over the years, can&amp;#39;t go wrong with anything really.<br&gt;<br&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a few things I&amp;#39;ve tried:<br&gt;-Avocado Eggrolls - Avocado lovers unite! Tons of it obviously with a couple other ingredients mixed in served with a tamarind dipping sauce.<br&gt;-Tex-Mex Eggrolls - Crispy rolls filled w/spicy chicken, corn, black beans, peppers, onions and melted cheese. Served with avocado cream and a pica de gallo.<br&gt;-Buffalo Bites - Lots of breading on this thing but for those who love buffalo sauce these are filled with chicken, cheese and wing sauce.<br&gt;-Crab Cakes - Three of them I believe and pretty tasty.<br&gt;-Meatballs with ricotta and garlic bread - Great meatballs and sauce, served with great bread for dipping<br&gt;-Chicken Scampi Pasta - All the great flavors of a scampi, delicious.<br&gt;-Steak Diane - Medallions of certified angus beef steak covered with black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce. Served with mashed potatoes and grilled onions. Great!<br&gt;-Pumpkin Cheesecake - If you like pumpkin pie you&amp;#39;ll adore this just the same.<br&gt;<br&gt;All sorts of drinks and a full bar is available.

I told him I did not then he frowned and said the wait would have to be about 5-10 minutes.

I was pretty close to the stand that the host could have just turned around and told me there was some issue but he didnt. I waited another 5 minutes and went up to ask him if there was a problem. He told me that there was some confusion and that they were getting reorganized. The other two parties that were called and asked to wait were ignored. He could have told them both the same but he did not. Another few minutes pass and another hostess arrives to take us to our seats. As we are walking, she looks at my daughter and myself and asks if I would like a kids menu instead. I notice at this point that the male host who took our name down had handed her two standard menus. Since my daughter is only 2 I found this very strange.

And I know that this is a prime location because it&amp;#39;s at the Grove. And I also realize that when you come with a large party, you&amp;#39;ll have quite a wait. We were a party of 8 and arrived right after lunch time, so I knew we would have to wait. We were told the wait was going to be around 30 mins, we received the buzzer at 1:34 pm.

I don&amp;#39;t think they realized I was also part of that same group bc I was standing next to the two greeters, while the rest of my party was on the other side. So I was literally over hearing what they were telling other parties about the wait, the order on the list, etc. Another large party came in to check on their status (and yes they arrived after us) and the same pleasant greeter told them they were third on the list. Then before I knew it, they were telling this party to go upstairs because their table was ready. At that point I told them, wait a sec, I just heard you tell them they were third while my party was supposedly next. The other greeter, answered me very rudely and said &amp;#34;Well, they&amp;#39;re a group of 7 and you&amp;#39;re 8&amp;#34; in which I replied, I understand but why did you tell us we were next&amp;#34; but I walked away to tell the rest of my party what happened. At this point it had been over an hour, we eventually spoke to the manager who was of no help. While we were still waiting for a table upstairs, the same rude greeter came upstairs passed by us, and made a rude gesture towards a member of our party.

When our server, April, arrived we were lucky to get a smile out of her. We placed our drink orders and I ordered an alcoholic drink - you know being 30 and all. I got asked for ID, which is fine. I provided the server with my Australian drivers licence. She glanced at my licence asked if I had my passport on me, which I told her no. (As a traveller I never carry my passport on my person in case I lose it or something happens). She then told me she can&amp;#39;t serve me any alcohol (I don&amp;#39;t even think she looked at the ID properly).

First of all, there was a ridiculously long wait (more than a 2 hour wait) for a table, so I decided to just ask them if me and my friend can order takeout instead. Even thought they were jam packed, they were kind enough to let us in and order upstairs. When we got there, the display of cheesecakes was unimaginable. It was like walking into a bakery filled with your favorite cakes (mine being cheesecake). We were going to order, but we decided to try to ask if there were any bar seatings open. To our surprise, they told us that it was open seating and we were free to grab any open seat. We were shocked when we walked over and found two open seats!!! It was too great, bypassing maybe about 30 parties and getting to sit down at the bar and order. The ambiance is absolutely terrific. Though slightly dark, it highlights the collection of liquor at the bar, along with the Christmas lighting outside on the main street (if you come during the holiday season).<br&gt;<br&gt;If you want to save room for dessert, I would recommend just ordering appetizers, which in my opinion, are better than their main courses. I got the loaded baked tater tots and buffalo chicken wings. The chicken wings were average, wasn&amp;#39;t bad, but didn&amp;#39;t stand out. However, their loaded baked tater tots were out of this world. Perfectly fried tater tots with cheese, bacon, and green onions, with sour cream to dip on the side. Oh man it couldn&amp;#39;t have been anymore perfect. Once you bite past the perfectly fried outer layer, the inside just melts in your mouth and you taste a creamy combination of cheese, potato, bacon, and green onions. And this appetizer is only $6 for about 10 of them. Definitely worth getting it. <br&gt;<br&gt;As for the desert, I tried the tuxedo cheesecake, recommended to me by my friend. And boy it did not disappoint. If you love chocolate, or anything sweet, get ready to taste chocolate on top of cheesecake on top of chocolate on top of more chocolate. Comprised of their fudge cake, chocolate cheesecake, mousse, and more chocolate, this cheesecake makes you feel like your mouth is swimming in chocolate (along with the two giant creamy, delicious mounds of whipped cream they top it with). <br&gt;<br&gt;This experience here couldn&amp;#39;t have been any better. To those with a party of 2 or 3, try the bar if the restaurant is too crowded.

It is literally the worst one I have never been to. Today supposed to be a great day for me because I and my friend are celebrating our admission result. I recommended that we should go to Cheesecake Factory, cause it is my favorite restaurant when I was in Texas. She wants to go to the Cafeteria for the Mediterranean food. I pulled her really hard to this diner. When I entered the waiting hall. I talked to the emotional dead waiter. I said : Hi, how are u, I would like a table for two, with my very big smile on my face. The response was simply just: you will need to wait 30min with a blank face, and that is it. I was like, Okay~~fine, maybe this gentleman don&amp;#39;t like to smile , nor response to greeting from customers, that is his personal choice ,totally respect. \u00a0After 20somehow times of waiting, I and my friend were summoned to the upstair. Then we went up, we got our booth with fork that still has some oil stains setting on our table. I thought, Ok this might because how busy this restaurant is, You know ppl do get mistakes, and I shouldn&amp;#39;t be a b1tch just ignore that one and don&amp;#39;t use it, which is no need to be panic at all. After that our waiter just brought us some iced water without asking what would we like to drink. I was like okay, Maybe 90% of customers order iced water all the time, they just assumed we will order that too. Next, he brought us with literally two bread hard edges( the head or the end of a bread, I don&amp;#39;t know how to say that) in a small white plate with 50% occupied by a giant ass butter. Then, I looked around to see that does anyone else&amp;#39;s entry bread has the same weird setting as ours. I was shocked by what I saw. Everyone (table for two just like us, not biased at all) was having a sophisticated iron basket with 4 pieces of bread sliced for them and a small plate of butter setting on the side. I was shocked and I feel really uncanny. Then I ask my friend how she thought about this, she told me to calm down, maybe they are running out of that basket or bread because they were so busy. After we ordered our meal, there was another new table of two coming next to us. I was really curious about what will their bread looks like. Not surprised at all, they were having the iron basket with those fancy setting. The only difference between all of us and all the rest was I and my friend are Asians, and all the other are Caucasians. I asked my friend is this racist? She told me I was just been over sensitive. After our meal was finished, I immediately asked to check out, because I was already really unpleasant. The table waiter was emotional dead the whole time ,like I slaughtered his whole family. He asked all the table around us in his section for &amp;#34;Hey, how was everything?&amp;#34; but us. I have no idea what did I do that offended him or this whole restaurant. I am the person who was making the smile face all the time, I am the one who was greeting all the staffs, and I am the one who will pay for the meal, why they treated me like this? Besides Racism, I cannot have another reason to fit the whole logic. The most interesting thing is that they dared to tell me that I can pay for my tip after they bring back my credit card for the payment. I was totally pissed, but my friend keep told me that ,it is fine just chill, I am totally overreacting. She paid for the tip with 18% ,cause I don&amp;#39;t want to at all. \u00a0And then we just left.

It was a really nice balance between fruity and rich, I think, which was why I liked it. I asked for no whipped cream because I felt like that would&amp;#39;ve been an overkill. The crust was perfect, not too soft or hard but the perfect texture. <br&gt;<br&gt;Basically: Try the desserts.

My friends and I went to cheesecake factory thinking we could get some of the &amp;#34;world&amp;#39;s best cheesecake&amp;#34; as a part of a suprise birthday celebration for one friend in our group who visited from another country. As we finally found a seat to settle for a party of six, we asked the waiter for a 6 inch whole cheesecake and found out that it would take over an hour after request. (Which is a huge delay!) He then gave us time to decide if we would want to make that purchase and decided we would wait, however once he came back, he told us that we may or may not be guaranteed the cheesecake after the 1 hour wait. Because of that, we decided to leave due to the extreme disappointment that this restaurant brought us. First of all, the Cheesecake factory should always have a whole cheesecake ready to go, having every single one frozen is completely ridiculous and only shows how unprepared the restaurant is to take on the demands of its customers. It&amp;#39;s called the cheesecake factory for a reason is it not? So how about you stop freezing the cheesecakes during open hours where some customers might want to eat it then and there. Even Marie Callanders has their pies ready to eat upon request for God sakes. Even Vons has whole cheesecakes ready to eat!! The fact that Cheesecake Factory of all places would have all their world famous whole cheesecakes frozen 24/7 is insane! Ready to eat whole cheesecakes should be available upon request!! It&amp;#39;s not even debatable for a restaurant looking to satisfy all customers. And for this, they will forever lose a customer. Also, the fact that our cheesecake was &amp;#34;not guaranteed&amp;#34; according to the waiter was also completely absurd. The customer should always be placed as a priority and tonight, our group did not recieve the treatment of customer priority. <br&gt; <br&gt;If I could rate 0/5 stars I would.

However, it does not constitute their rude behavior and unwarranted comments. The other Yelp reviewers were right when they said that the service was bad. I&amp;#39;ve withheld the waiters&amp;#39; names to protect their rights.<br&gt;<br&gt;Waiter 1 - Everything was going okay in the beginning and he even took our group photos (not well, unfortunately). Then he wrote down our orders: 1 Da Vinci Pasta, 1 Chicken Scampi, 3 Chicken Madeira, and 1 Bang Bang Chicken. He repeated the order and we thought we were good. Twenty to 30 minutes later, our order arrives, but instead of 3 Madeiras, 2 other waiters bring in 3 Chicken Scampis. We tell them that we only ordered 1 Chicken Scampi. <br&gt;<br&gt;The waiters go back and probably caused a commotion because Waiter 1 comes over shortly and says aloud, &amp;#34;Next time, be careful with what you order&amp;#34;, trying to take the blame away from himself and putting it on us. Remember, the guy repeated the order before he left, but he tells us that we got it wrong? \u00a0He quickly leaves before we could say anything--we were shocked. <br&gt;<br&gt;The manager must have gotten word and came over to apologize about the mistake on our order. We told her what rude Waiter 1 said and we confirmed it was only him, and not the other waitress who also attended to us (but more on her later). The manager offered two soups on the house. This lady, unlike her waiters, has good PR and customer service. She alone deserves a star.<br&gt;<br&gt;Waiter 2 - She was the waiter who tended to us for the remainder of the evening. We thought everything was going smoothly, but we were mistaken. One of us in our party had spoken with this waitress early on to let them know that we had 2 birthday celebrants. When it was time for dessert, our friend asked Waiter 2 if she remembered what they spoke about and if they had some kind of birthday treat (which they&amp;#39;ve done in the past, along with singing &amp;#39;Happy Birthday&amp;#39;; they even did it that same night for a different table). Waiter 2 says with an attitude that came out of no where: &amp;#34;We don&amp;#39;t offer free cheesecakes; if we did, everyone would be coming here&amp;#34;. <br&gt;<br&gt;First of all, our friend didn&amp;#39;t ask for a free cheesecake. She was trying to help you recall your earlier conversation. Secondly, you are in the customer service industry--what is up with the attitude and why? It seems that Waiter 2, for reasons known only to her, mistook what our friend said. Waiter 2 continues to ask if whether we&amp;#39;d like to order dessert, gives us some time, and leaves to pack up our leftovers. When she came back, we declined in ordering desserts and instead asked for the bill.<br&gt;<br&gt;Did we leave a tip? No way. Would anyone in their right mind leave a tip after being insulted? Twice? No, and no thanks. <br&gt;<br&gt;We won&amp;#39;t be coming back to this Cheesecake Factory located at The Grove. There&amp;#39;s a long wait (they don&amp;#39;t take reservations), they have rude and untrained waiters, and bad lighting. The only good thing was the manager. Someone give her a raise! With that said, we don&amp;#39;t want any of the waiters to be fired from their jobs; we simply want to let it be known that their attitude and behavior was insulting and uncalled for. <br&gt;<br&gt;After this bad experience, we brought our party to Marmalade Cafe at the Farmer&amp;#39;s Market side for dessert.

He got us our drinks and we asked him for some bread as we ordered our meals. This is the reason for the 2 star. I am not joking, but I set my timer on my phone to check and see how long it took for him to get us the bread. 20 minutes go by and no bread!!! We flagged down another server that was walking by and mentioned to her that we requested bread from our server but he never got it. She was nice enough and brought us the bread herself. At this point its been 7 more minutes when she finally got us the bread. We did see our server walk up and down to the table across from us and next to us with bread and drink refills. Finally, another 15 minutes after we got the bread we get our meals. We requested refills on the drinks and more bread (its 3 of us and we&amp;#39;re starving) . As we started eating our Santa Fe chicken salads we both noticed there was NO chicken in any of the 2 salads. I order the lunch size and my husband ordered the full size, the menu clearly says &amp;#34;marinated chicken&amp;#34; so I was expecting some kind of marinated chicken. We have ordered this salad at other locations and have notices they add very little chicken, not to say none. By the time the server came back to check on us again, we were almost done with our meals, but when he did we mentioned to him the chicken issue and he did in fact apologize (that is why I did 2 stars even though the chicken is not his fault but he did apologize) he \u00a0offer to bring us some chicken on the side or change our meals.

We still like it here and will continue to return but there are some niggles and it&amp;#39;s not always 100%....for one, they have an awful noise problem inside, one that I&amp;#39;m not even sure they are aware of. We sat inside on Sunday night and it was awful, we were almost shouting our conversation to each other, the racket caused by staff clattering knives and forks was deafening as was overall staff noise. It reminded me of a school canteen. The music was much lower on the decibel list than the staff and kitchen noises flooding out and even drowned out customer chatter. Not a pleasant noise. Especially not a nice noise To try and sip a nice Malbec in! There is a time issue too as we have twice still been eating starters when hot mains come out? Who wants to sit watching $30 of main courses go cold?....Also, I don&amp;#39;t know why they feel that it&amp;#39;s a nice idea to leave a gap of 4cm between tables for 2, it was ridiculous, we were a 2 but almost a forced table of 4, which was uncomfortable, but this shouldn&amp;#39;t have to be pointed out, lastly the whole bill nonsense coming far earlier than you want it is just rude, annoying, interrupts conversations, puts pressure on the customers to leave and if they have a $40 near full bottle of red sat in front of them it&amp;#39;s not nice. I feel sometimes that the real acid test is that the manager goes in the restaurant and sits like a customer and sees and hears and feels what they do, it&amp;#39;s a test which I&amp;#39;m sure would always see changes. We received the bill without asking for it with a lot of wine left in our bottle and she brought the bill and said ,no rush sir, but there is, always is, as we continued to talk she came back and picked up the empty wallet, interrupting us again,we apologised saying we hadn&amp;#39;t done it yet..... We stopped our conversation yet again at a point we hadn&amp;#39;t planned, he ruffled through the wallet.... Just a rude interruption, there is clearly a rush, they hover around, watching for cards going in wallets, you feel uncomfortable, rushed and after paying we put some cash tip under a glass after getting our card back and we were interrupted again with a snatch of the cash and her saying &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ll get that out of your way sir, .........it wasn&amp;#39;t in our way? I can understand it when they need tables, both times there were many spare tables so it&amp;#39;s just their practice I suppose. Saying all that, All the food seems to come out well, we especially love the Thai chicken wrap starter using lettuce leaves and triple Chinese style sauces. Most of the startrpers we have tried and we love, the small Greek salad is especially tasty. We really hated a dish of strawberry shortcake last week where a soggy super large biscuit was placed floating in red sugar syrup, served with equally marinated in sugar syrup strawberries with ok ice cream and a huge amount of cream to give it the ridiculous effect of a tower......not nice in so many ways,sickly, ridiculously too large and soggy and sugary.", "rating": 4, "date": "4/27/2015"}, {"text": "Cheesecake Factory has amazing food and menu, no matter the locations I&amp;#39;ve be too.

He finally arrives with water and what we had ordered for dessert, without bringing out bread or our appetizers or our entree. We asked for the check early.

As a large national chain restaurant, I feel it&amp;#39;s quite overhyped, but it does have its advantages. I tried to organize the pros and cons from my limited Cheesecake experiences:<br&gt;<br&gt;PROS<br&gt;1. professional and friendly service. excellent, especially for a large corporation chain. they cater to your preferences as best they can; I once asked for a different type of pasta in my dish and they were very open to substitutions/requests. <br&gt;<br&gt;2. the free unlimited bread. I personally like the white french bread with olive oil and butter (the waiter will give you the olive oil if you ask), but many of my friends prefer the slightly sweeter brown bread. <br&gt;<br&gt;3. the wide variety of food for a relatively decent price. steaks, pastas, salads, soups, desserts -- there are almost too many options. <br&gt;<br&gt;CONS<br&gt;1. can be a long wait. avoid mealtimes and you&amp;#39;ll be able to get in within half an hour or so. <br&gt;<br&gt;2. very dark inside. my eyes always hurt from straining to see my food and the faces of the people I&amp;#39;m speaking with. may make for an intimate setting with a date, but not really apt for large parties or families.<br&gt;<br&gt;3. the extensive menu does include some faulty dishes; it&amp;#39;s a hit or miss type of thing. here are the ones i&amp;#39;ve tried and still remember:<br&gt;<br&gt;Steak Diane - good beef with a good mushroom sauce, tastes superb cooked medium rare. <br&gt;<br&gt;Shrimp Scampi - large shrimp with a slight crunch in a citrus, garlic sauce <br&gt;<br&gt;Chicken lettuce wraps - nothing special, just some chicken and vegetables wrapped in lettuce with a sauce commonly found in Mexican places. my mom really likes them; they&amp;#39;re meant to be appetizers, but can serve as a light meal. the lettuce adds a nice refreshing crunch when you&amp;#39;re not ordering salad.<br&gt;<br&gt;Spicy chicken chipotle pasta - not spicy at all, actually sort of sweet. the sauce gets cold pretty quickly, and you&amp;#39;re left with a clumpy mess of a dish. <br&gt;<br&gt;Jambalaya pasta - the spices&amp;#39; balance is pretty good, but gets cold and nasty quickly as well. I don&amp;#39;t recommend the pasta dishes here. <br&gt;<br&gt;Original cheesecake - very good; after all, they get their name from this signature dish. <br&gt;<br&gt;Tiramisu cheesecake - DIDN&amp;#39;T HAVE A GRAHAM CRUST!! i felt cheated. the tiramisu cake part was merely eh, and the cheesecake part wasn&amp;#39;t as superb as the original cheesecake. the chocolate mousse/whipped cream on top made the dessert extremely decadent and sweet. I would stick to the basic cheesecake. <br&gt;<br&gt;Sundae - got a free sundae on my birthday; there was only a spoonful of extremely sweet vanilla ice cream buried under a LOT of whipped cream and sitting on top of black chocolate fudge. it was free, but didn&amp;#39;t feel like a big deal. <br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br&gt;Sides - tried the fries, salad, and mashed potatoes; all are decent.<br&gt;<br&gt;just some of my thoughts on a much reviewed restaurant.", "rating": 3, "date": "7/29/2013"}, {"text": "The service here is amazing!

The Red Velvet Cheesecake is great too but I&amp;#39;m a CHOCOHOLIC, so I gotta have CHOCOLATE on them. hehe.<br&gt;<br&gt;Dang, just thinking about those Cheesecake fus making me crave for a box full of cheesecake.

We had a baby in a stroller on the elevator. \u00a0 Nobody said, &amp;#34;hey we are sorry, let us check that out&amp;#34;. \u00a0It would have at least been small comfort that the next person wasn&amp;#39;t going to get demolished by a broken elevator. \u00a03. The manager could not have cared less and never asked us to specifically describe what happened. \u00a0Just usher us on to the table and back to work. \u00a0I did see the manager go get on the elevator, I think ride it down and back up. \u00a0She got off and that was that. \u00a0Never a question about specifically what went wrong, what was she looking for, etc...<br&gt;We sat for the next few minutes discussing how sad it would be if someone got seriously injured on the elevator because nobody was listening. \u00a0We relayed the information to the couple who joined us a few minutes later and eventually got on with our meal. \u00a0I&amp;#39;d like to make sure whoever reads this understands that my complaint is not with the hostess or the elevator problem itself - but with the casual dismissal that the manager gave in not caring the least about a potential safety issue. \u00a0Unless she is some kind of qualified elevator technician - her riding it up and down once hardly counts as checking it for a safety issue. \u00a0Please have someone that checks this kind of thing (probably have one that works for the Grove, it&amp;#39;s a huge place) look into this ASAP.<br&gt;As an aside - about my dining experience:<br&gt;1.

When seated my table was greasy with butter streaks. \u00a0It&amp;#39;s not likely someone already had a meal since this location only opens 25 minutes before we were seated so whoever wiped the table down did not go a good job. \u00a0I had to use my napkin to wipe off the butter streaks. \u00a0It was clear someone with a seriously dirty table cloth had wiped it off but was still super gross to set my arms in butter streaks. \u00a0This was the only uncool part of my actual dining experience.

Some things are the same, some different.

In fact, if you have any time issues that day at all, don&amp;#39;t go here. Go only if you have a good half day to kill and can laze around eating good food.<br&gt;<br&gt;And I&amp;#39;m so serious about that.<br&gt;<br&gt;I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many times I raised my own blood pressure when I forgot that about the Cheesecake Factory. If you&amp;#39;ve waited less than a half hour at any Cheesecake Factory, you are doing amazingly well. Plan on an hour before you even get seated. I&amp;#39;m so serious.<br&gt;<br&gt;At the Grove, they also have the added hassle of not enough seating while you&amp;#39;re waiting. So, even before you get to the main seating guy, there&amp;#39;s a pre-seating guy outside. You leave your name with him/her, and wait.<br&gt;<br&gt;Then, you go inside, and wait some more. If you&amp;#39;re lucky, after about half an hour, maybe you can grab a seat on the one bench they have there.<br&gt;<br&gt;Just about the time your skin is crawling and you are thinking: &amp;#34;GOD, screw this! The food isn&amp;#39;t THAT good...&amp;#34; they&amp;#39;ll call your name, or your buzzer will blink and vibrate, and up the long escalator you&amp;#39;ll go.<br&gt;<br&gt;Where you&amp;#39;ll be greeted by another seating person. (sigh) And wait. Sigh.<br&gt;<br&gt;Finally, finally, you get to your table. Do yourself a favor, immediately. Order an appetizer with your drink, as soon as the wait person gets there. I recommend the firecracker rolls. You will thank me for this later.<br&gt;<br&gt;You do this \u00a0because you have a long wait ahead of you until you see food, or possibly a server again. Plus, the menu is GIGANTIC. It&amp;#39;s seriously like twelve pages long. The first two pages are drinks. A couple pages of appetizers. Then six pages of entrees. All of them are amazing. Trust me, I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of stuff on their menu.<br&gt;<br&gt;This is why you deal with the excruciating, wanna slit your wrists wait. THE FOOD.

In fact, whenever anyone has said, &amp;#34;Hey, let&amp;#39;s go to the Cheesecake Factory!&amp;#34; there has never been a time I said No.<br&gt;<br&gt;One of my most frequent choices is the popcorn chicken, served with yummy mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. But there is everything from Thai choices to pizza to pasta to great salads. Incredible food. And I always always always end up taking it home because there is so much of it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Well, that and the fact that you most often want to save room for dessert. Because after all, it is the CHEESECAKE Factory. And when I say they have cheesecake, sweet Lordy, do they have cheesecakes.<br&gt;<br&gt;Pumpkin and chocolate and strawberry and hazelnut and peanut butter whatever flavor you crave. Cheesecakes for the holidays. Cheesecakes that you only dream of. Every cheesecake you can imagine.

It was first of all not out fault that the 2 host in the front said it was a 45 to an hour wait. Or else we would have never waited to begin with. The host said she mistakingly meant 4-5 hour wait.

One thing I did NOT like about him was his continuous &amp;#39;probing&amp;#39; if we wanted anything more. I mean it&amp;#39;s his job to make sure to check up on us, but I believe it was a tad bit too much. :x<br&gt;<br&gt;Onto the good stuff. Their bread is really good. They have two types: sourdough and wheat. They continuously give you bread/butter in case your mouth gets lonely. :D Yay! We ordered fried calamari and quesadillas for appetizers. I have to say that their appetizers were WAY better than my actual entree. Their batter was really crispy and nice but the calamari inside was so soft (in a good way)! Dipping in the tartar sauce made it like 10x better. Their quesadillas were also super good. Very big and cheesy accompanied with guacamole (chunky just the way I like it ;D ), sour cream, and salsa. The food was just okay. Well, my dish was. I ordered the spicy chipotle chicken pasta, which was bland and I wasn&amp;#39;t too fond of it. I took about half of it in a to-go box. The pasta was okay and the sauce tasted funny. My other friends ordered steaks, which were good from what they said. The fries that came with them (sweet potato and regular) were no-nos. Another friend of mine got something &amp;#34;Thai chicken wrap&amp;#34; or something like that. It was pretty good considering that over half of the dish lacked carbohydrates/protein. Other than that, I&amp;#39;d rate the food a 3.5 (only my dish though). Onto desserts. Most of my group did not get desserts because we were stuffed. I forgot to mention. The portions are HUGE. No joke. I guess that&amp;#39;s one other thing that&amp;#39;s good about this place. They also have a cr** load of cheesecake options.
