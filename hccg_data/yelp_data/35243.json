Most restaurant cut down on menu items to help a kitchen produce more smoothly and efficiently. At the Cheesecake Factory you pay a bit more but you got a ton of menu options . The expansive menu is great for groups because there is something for everyone. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food is generally very good. I find that the cheese cake factory is better than other more specialized restaurants. For example, the Cheesecake Factory can make better Cajun inspired cuisine than a Cajun restaurant. (Such as Cajun steamer)<br&gt;<br&gt;The interior is nicely decorated; the lightly is casual and comfortable. They have outdoor seating which is nice during the evening when the sub sets.<br&gt;<br&gt;A few things enter my mind when considering flaws. First, the menu is full of advertisements. Second, it&amp;#39;s a bit more expensive for comparable dishes at other restaurants .

I ordered a hamburger, and specifically asked for no mayonnaise. When it finally arrived, I immediately noticed the bun was covered in it. The manager, Nick, stopped by the table to see if everyone&amp;#39;s food was fine. I mentioned my original request, and he quickly took the plate back to the kitchen and said he would take care of it. He arrives back shortly after with the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; burger. I lift up the bun and burger, which still has mayonnaise on it. It had clearly been wiped off and still on the same burger. The waitress came back and asked if it was alright, and I explained the burger still had mayonnaise. She told me that they just replaced the bun, not the burger, and took it back. The manager then comes back and tells me the burger never had mayonnaise on it, and that they &amp;#34;sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top.&amp;#34; I told him that that was not part of the description, and regardless the bottom still had mayonnaise and I could tell it had been wiped off. He then proceeded to tell me that it never had mayonnaise on it in the first place, and says &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m not going to argue with you, but I looked at it under the light,&amp;#34; and then stormed off. The waitress then returned to the table to apologize and let me know she forgot to let the kitchen know not to put mayonnaise, and told me that indeed, the burger had mayonnaise, contrary to Nick&amp;#39;s response... Nick was extremely rude and unprofessional. I was with a group celebrating a friend&amp;#39;s birthday, and we were appalled with how he handled the situation. The waitress was extremely sweet and I asked her to just cancel my order. By this point, I was upset that the manager would accuse me of lying, and everyone was finished eating and ordering dessert. The waitress then sent another manager over (I didn&amp;#39;t catch his name), and he was very apologetic. He handled the situation great and apologized for our experience.
