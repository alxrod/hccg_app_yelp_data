I wanted to do Cheesecake Factory, which was perfect, A Cheesecake Factory at this location. So convenient, This Cheesecake Factory is huge! There are lots of parking and I scored a perfect spot, close to restaurant and as we walked in, no wait! We were seated promptly. This never happens in Hawaii. We got our menu and the waitress was super nice and quick during our entire visit. It was also late, we were there after 8 pm on a Sunday, we were in and out of Cheesecake Factory within one hour. I usually stick to my usual ( miso salmon, the mini chicken sliders, or calamari) as I glanced thru the menu booklet, something on the specialties menu caught my eye. Chicken Parmesan &amp;#34;Pizza Style&amp;#34;, chopped chicken breast coated with breadcrumbs, covered with marinara sauce, and lots of melted cheese, then topped with angel hair pasta in a alfredo cream sauce. (15.95) <br&gt;This sounds so good, I love pasta, angel hair, chicken parm, and alfredo cream sauce, all of my faves in one dish, so I had to try this. Talking to the waitress, I think only this Cheesecake Factory has this specialty, I don&amp;#39;t see it back in Hawaii, another reason that I must go back to this location again. My daughter always gets her favorite, Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic (17.95) the bow tie pasta is so cute. <br&gt;On my pic, doesn&amp;#39;t come with mushrooms, since my daughter doesn&amp;#39;t like mushrooms, it was by request to <br&gt;add them from my daughter&amp;#39;s entree to mines. *bonus*<br&gt;I really enjoyed my chicken parmesan pizza style, it was really filling, lots of carbs, I was stuffed eating half of my entree. Since it was my daughter&amp;#39;s 22nd birthday, she got the lemon cheesecake, nicely decorated and the staff came by to sing and wish her a Happy Birthday. That was so nice! <br&gt;The lemon cheesecake was so good and refreshing, first time trying. <br&gt;Overall, we had a great dining experience at this Cheesecake Factory, on her special day.

Our waitresses and waiters each time have been pleasant. Usually like to get the caesar salad and farm fresh breakfast. <br&gt;I feel personally that the happy hour menu doesn&amp;#39;t give me many options (I can never find a single thing on there that sounds good to me, which is surprising considering their normal menu is pages long) <br&gt;I feel menu prices are still high for what you get. For example a small salad (with no meat) was still $7. If you want a grilled chicken caesar it&amp;#39;s $20. If you have two people there just getting salad and a drink your tab is over $50. <br&gt;Last time we went we did notice they&amp;#39;ve changed the milkshakes. Used to be a huge glass and tasted better. Now tastes like Breyers blended with chocolate syrup (which I could easily make at home) served in a normal size glass... BUT they still have it priced at 8.50! If you&amp;#39;re going to make it smaller at least make the price reflective of that. It was definitely not worth 8.50 and we were disappointed in it not being at all close to how it used to be. <br&gt;At least I split it with someone (who also said it was not the same) because if we both had paid 8.50 for that we would&amp;#39;ve brought it up while we were there.

If not for that it would be one star, only because they require at least one. <br&gt;<br&gt;We made reservations online for 8:00pm, for dine in service. We arrived at 7:45 and checked in with the hostess who was standing outside the doorway at a table that was set up. She found our reservation and said it would just be a few minutes and we would receive a text letting us know the table was ready. We stepped aside and waited outside for the text. Over the course of time several other couples/families came up after us, I was able to overhear some had reservations and some did not. They also waited outside to maintain social distancing guidelines. As time went on all were notified that a table was ready and were seated before us that were originally there first. We were the only people left outside waiting. We continued to wait for a minute or two and finally at 8:20 we went inside to speak with the hostess and inquire about our table as we had been waiting 20 minutes past our reservation. This new hostess asked our name and proceeded to look it up. She stated there was no reservation under that name even though we have text confirmations of the reservation and text reminders stating the day and time. Regardless she was able to seat us right away which was a positive. <br&gt;<br&gt;They do not give you menus. You have to look it up online. Which we did. Found what we wanted and ordered. I had some special requests on mine, Bow tie pasta with roasted chicken. I specifically asked for Parmesan crusted chicken instead of roasted chicken which I got. I also requested no mushrooms and no peas (due to an allergy) and add asparagus instead. <br&gt;<br&gt;Entrees arrived and seemed fine, I actually really enjoyed my food. Of course my husband eats faster then me and he made it through his steak and went to eat the chicken dish (he got one of the speciality splits) while eating it he kept getting lemon seeds he had to spit out while chewing the chicken. He also ordered a side of spinach. It was exceptionally oily/watery on the bottom of the dish and salty. We asked to speak with a manager to make them aware that their food preparation had a few issues. Not once did we ask him to comp anything just to make them aware that the food was at a lower standard then TGI Friday&amp;#39;s . <br&gt;<br&gt;When telling him about the lemon seeds he said &amp;#39;yea, when they plate it they squeeze fresh lemon over it&amp;#39;. My thoughts on the statement &amp;#39;uhhhh yea obviously but there are ways to prevent having lemon seeds end up in it.... say a strainer or putting the free hand underneath to catch the seeds&amp;#39; Then explaining the concerns about the spinach and excess oil/water/liquid he just asked if we wanted another one. Again &amp;#39;ugggghhh NO just use a fricking STRAINER.&amp;#39; Which is apparently something missing in the kitchen. I have at least three at home I&amp;#39;ll let you borrow one - he was a complete jerk. <br&gt;<br&gt;I finally was done eating and asked for boxes for the excess food. Our lovely waitress brought them and I started to put my food away and when I was nearly done I noticed something concerning. Peas. There were peas in the bottom of the dish. I had to get the attention of our waitress as this was just another issue and now I get to have an allergic reaction. Thankfully it&amp;#39;s just itching, hives, and swelling in my lips and throat. I asked if there was a different manager on the floor as I felt like the previous one I had spoken to was a condescending prick. She said she would speak to a different manager and send them out to us, but in an apparent &amp;#39;miscommunication due to a loud kitchen and face masks&amp;#39; condescending prick showed up back at our table. <br&gt;<br&gt;I explained my specific request of no peas and showed him that there were peas in my dish. He asked &amp;#39;did you tell your server that you had an allergy&amp;#39; I said &amp;#39;no, I just strictly stated that I did not want them in the dish&amp;#39; he said &amp;#39;well for future reference in any restaurant you need to say that you have an allergy because then everything is done different. Do you want something else?&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Uhhh, no, not from you. My husband just has lunch for tomorrow now and I don&amp;#39;t have the time to wait I need to get home and get a Benadryl&amp;#39; (it was around 9:40). <br&gt;<br&gt;I thought saying no peas meant no peas. Now it is my fault that your kitchen can&amp;#39;t read or understand what basic food preparation is. <br&gt;<br&gt;Thanks condescending prick - Stephen. Night ruined.

I asked him what is the smallest cake he had and he told me a 10 inch one for double the price. Since it was my daughter&amp;#39;s birthday and she specifically asked for it, I went ahead and bought it. Lucas told me they were ready made. I was very surprised to see him go in the back area and put strawberries on a plain cheesecake, then charge the higher price. <br&gt;<br&gt;I had to wait over half an hour for Lucas to make the strawberry cheesecake. He did not apologize for the wait or say thank you. Will never go back nor recommend this place to anyone. <br&gt;<br&gt;After reading a few other reviews, it is highly recommended to never pre-order a cheesecake here. <br&gt;<br&gt;There are too many good restaurants and better bakeries that do a great job and get the orders right without the wait.", "rating": 1, "date": "3/26/2016"}, {"text": "My family and I love coming here.

I&amp;#39;m thinking really? did this person really just ask me that question?<br&gt;<br&gt;Given the elbow to elbow seating, I waited for the people sitting next to me to leave before I spoke to my server - as I didn&amp;#39;t want to embarrass her in front of those people. \u00a0Yeah, I had a little more respect for her then she had for me. So the people next to me leave, and I tell her how inappropriate it was to tell a customer that, clearly implying they&amp;#39;re some dishonest schmuck who can&amp;#39;t wait in a line. \u00a0She goes on to say something along the lines of &amp;#34;well we have a problem with that&amp;#34; - people just sitting down apparently. \u00a0And how that&amp;#39;s my problem, I&amp;#39;ve yet to understand. \u00a0Total lack of accountability and I think my telling her this sailed right over her head. \u00a0If this location has a problem with people sitting down at tables, perhaps they should look into fixing their seating issues, but treating customers like criminals is totally inexcusable. <br&gt;<br&gt;Needless to say I won&amp;#39;t be going back to this establishment again. \u00a0Even despite this unfortunate event, this particular Cheesecake factory isn&amp;#39;t worth waiting in line 30 seconds for. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;PS: The manager, at least it seemed to be the manager, was going from table to table like some Disneyland automaton asking each person the exact same canned question if they were enjoying their &amp;#34;experience&amp;#34; or something along those lines - with as much genuine interest as some Washington DC politician. \u00a0He didn&amp;#39;t even seem to pause long enough to hear someone&amp;#39;s answer :) Priceless.

Instead of bringing us both water, he only brings water for one person. One of the next times he came around I asked him to please bring another water. Instead of bringing another water, he quickly grabbed the 1 cup of water that was already there and refilled it and came back. Wow. Next, we had some guacamole which was actually not that bad aside from the salsa that accompanied it which was basically just diced tomatoes out of a can. After that, I ordered a margherita pizza.

So thank you cheesecake factory for making my moms mother day dinner one for the memery book.

Firstly, and I know this isn&amp;#39;t the waiter&amp;#39;s fault because he was clearly trained to act completely fake and overbearing, but he was fake and overbearing. All of the staff had giant &amp;#39;cheesy&amp;#39; smiles. It was uncomfortable.<br&gt;<br&gt;We went for happy hour and I ordered $5 nachos, a good deal, right? Wrong.

WTF????? helllls no. i call the manager. he says, on let me check and see about that, that&amp;#39;s not right. im standing in front of him waiting to hear whats up.. and he get&amp;#39;s diverted. then a party of 10 gets called in and then a table of 8 get&amp;#39;s called in.. more time pass and i&amp;#39;m like, for real can you tell me how long the wait is now because we&amp;#39;re all here all waiting and it&amp;#39;s been over an hour and a half. so he said, okay looks like the table we have you guys set up for has people still there, they have already paid and usually we estimate a big party to dine for about an hour to tops an hour and a half. it&amp;#39;s now been an hour and 45 minutes and it&amp;#39;s our policy that we can&amp;#39;t ask them to leave. sooo i&amp;#39;m like damn if you guys can&amp;#39;t ask, i sure as hell can. he standing there offering free appetizers and stuff.. im like damn. and just as i was going to walk over there, the party decides to leave. so he&amp;#39;s like, a few minutes as we clean your table. great. they pretty much gave our table away and mixed up our &amp;#34;reservations&amp;#34; big bunch of jerks. manager was nice afterwards.. and our waitresses weren&amp;#39;t terrible. food was good and the cheese cake was even better. i got the factory chopped salad and b had the meatloaf. both never fail and b had an extra slice to take to work in a meatloaf sandwich whoop whoop! friends had really good food too.. bbq salmon, mushroom burger, tomato basil shrimp angel hair. i know for sure the tomato basil shrimp pasta was good.. as for everything else, i didn&amp;#39;t get to try it. everything was pretty spendy. i wasn&amp;#39;t so happy about my drink. they DO NOT make a mean mojito. don&amp;#39;t get it here. what else..? that&amp;#39;s all for now. ill update if there&amp;#39;s more. 3.5 stars for the food. 1 star for the customer service. ultimate FAIL in customer service.", "rating": 2, "date": "11/20/2010"}, {"text": "I just came back from Cheesecake Factory happy hour and it wasn&amp;#39;t bad. \u00a0I had the mojito which was good and at only $5 it was even better! \u00a0My gal pal had the dirty raspberry lemonade which was tart and refreshingly sweet and my other friend had the strawberry lemonade which was great too! \u00a0The most positive thing about this HH menu is that they offer their most popular appetizers for only $5 and the portions are the regular sized ones so it was enough to fill us up. \u00a0Of course we got the fried mac and cheese which was so divine I ended up ordering some to-go for the husband. \u00a0We also ordered the crab dip which was ok but the bread served on the side was too greasy. \u00a0We also had the calamari which didn&amp;#39;t have much flavor and the potstickers which were unimpressive. \u00a0Overall, I am impressed with the portions you get for the price and it&amp;#39;s a great deal, but the food could use some flavor (aside from the fried mac and cheese of course!) \u00a0There are limited seats in the bar during happy hour though so come early or prepare to wait!", "rating": 4, "date": "4/30/2010"}, {"text": "Not sure why some people don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; to like chain restaurants, my husband and I LOVE the CCF. \u00a0 It&amp;#39;s super busy and there are waits because it is fantastic and popular. \u00a0I have never had a bad meal here, and we&amp;#39;ve been going to CCF long before it ever came to Portland. \u00a0Great food, awesome selection, always yummy leftovers to take home. \u00a0Service is always amazing, too. \u00a0Now we take our daughter and she loves it as well..thank you CCF for finally getting a kid&amp;#39;s menu, which in the past was the only thing we didn&amp;#39;t like.", "rating": 5, "date": "11/21/2010"}]}
