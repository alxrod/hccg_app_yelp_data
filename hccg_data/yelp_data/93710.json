You certainly wouldn&amp;#39;t get tired of the menu too quickly.<br&gt;<br&gt;The booth was a little tight and is probably made for people who don&amp;#39;t eat here very often, or anywhere else for that matter. It was tight. I don&amp;#39;t know if the bread is made on site or not but it&amp;#39;s a nice variety, very fresh and nicely warmed. They also serve it with a nice slab of butter unlike a lot of places where there are some skimpy little and not enough. The appetizers were delicious looking and we got an order of the avocado eggrolls. These were huge, rich, and the perfect amount for three people. The sauce that came with it was a nice contrast.<br&gt;<br&gt;For my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the chicken and biscuits with gravy. I enjoyed those dishes it came with mashed red potatoes which were quite yummy. I did not eat the biscuits which is not uncommon. Besides they were hard. The chicken was pretty basic and it had some vegetables like carrots and peas. The portion did not disappoint.<br&gt;<br&gt;I was quite happy to skip the cheesecake and opted for their tiny little complementary birthday dessert which was basically five spoonfuls of some kind of fudge and whip cream. It was more than enough. I asked them not to sing happy birthday to me as I totally hate being fussed over. Besides my birthday was several days ago!<br&gt;<br&gt;My parents really enjoyed this restaurant and it was very nice for them in particular. It was palatial, elegant, and offered them all sorts of really nice choices. Best yet the meal for three of us was only like $78 with the tip. I had treated them to Flemings next-door a couple months back and I think it was over $300. And the meal wasn&amp;#39;t that great.

An added bonus is the free bread to sustain you while waiting for your food (don&amp;#39;t forget to ask for olive oil and vinaigrette as you only get butter).

Cheesecake factory is a chain, they are a brand, so consistency is key with a big chain like them. I&amp;#39;m from the bay area and regularly go to 3 Cheesecake factory locations regularly over there. My recent trip here to the Fresno location, allows me to confirm my original statement above. Nice location just outside of Fashion Fair mall, the exterior and interior of this CF is as nice in it&amp;#39;s own unique way, but still provides that similar CF vibe you get familiar with if you go to several different locations. Actually, this Fresno location I can even say has a better restaurant because it has it&amp;#39;s own detached building. For those familiar in the bay area, the Valley Fair and Oakridge locations are attached to the main mall. So being detached and separate gives this a more fancier feel. <br&gt;<br&gt;Inside restaurant is full of the usual CF classy design and has high airy ceilings. I&amp;#39;ve ate at this location 3 times and it&amp;#39;s always been clean. Staff has always been great too. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food here is on par with other CF locations in terms of quality and portion. For those new to CF, its higher quality than Applebees and Chilli&amp;#39;s. Provides a better dining experience and ambiance. When comparing it to CHAIN restaurants, when you want one of the better ones, you can&amp;#39;t go wrong with CF. And thus the reason for my perfect score as compared to other chain restaurants, I feel CF is still the most superior, and this location has provided me with the quality and familiarity of what CF represents. <br&gt;<br&gt;P.S. shout out to the Alyssa C, who helped me with a tedious task of Gift Cards on 12/22/2018.

The main reason for not eating here is because I&amp;#39;ve been improving my diet and quality of the food that I eat, most recently trying to follow the Forks Over Knives way of eating. I recently heard that CF offers a a vegan cobb salad and was excited to try it after unexpectedly finding myself at CF on Mother&amp;#39;s Day. I was pleasantly surprised by this salad. The salad contains beets, grilled asparagus, cucumbers, avocados, quinoa sprinkled with almonds, garbanzo beans and tomatoes, over a bed of what looked like romaine and spring mix? This salad is not listed on the menu, or not that Ive seen, and had no clue how much it cost. When the bill came for our group of 5, the vegan salad was listed as being only $8. \u00a0I enjoyed the salad so much that I have really been looking forward to going back. Yesterday my husband and I returned to CF specifically for this salad and thinking we would be eating lunch pretty inexpensively. We were quite surprised when our bill was over $40. When I looked at the bill, the salad was $13 each. Though I do enjoy the salad, it IS NOT worthy of $13. I would have gone somewhere else to spend $40. Plus tip was $50 because we always tip 20% unless service is extremely bad. Our waitress didn&amp;#39;t seem that she even wanted to be there. When we asked what was in the dipping sauce of my husband&amp;#39;s cauliflower appetizer she replied &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t know,&amp;#34; and didn&amp;#39;t even offer to find out even though we were asking her about health conscious options without dairy or egg in the ingredients. This most recent was quite disappointing. I&amp;#39;ve heard that CF is very accommodating when asking for certain variations for special diets, but our waitress didn&amp;#39;t want to take the extra step and find out. Additionally, isn&amp;#39;t it their job to know what is in something? Needless to say, the &amp;#34;aioli&amp;#34; for the cauliflower was very much ranch dressing based.

But besides the cold food and having to throw away most of it, with my Mother missing her entree; I was not satisfied with the experience. The customer service was great and accommodating just not the food quality.

My order was buffalo wings it came with blue cheese dipping and I asked for ranch dipping. I was enjoying my wings and talking to my friend I ate about haft of the chicken wings when I notice something red on the bone I thought it was the red buffalo sauce but I took a picture of it and the chicken wings was raw, I felt disgusted. I quickly let the waitress know about the raw chicken, she took it to the back and told the manager and show the manager the raw chicken. The manager, I believe his name is call Sal ( he looks Southeast Asian) he came in he said &amp;#34;what seems to be the problem?&amp;#34; Me, didn&amp;#39;t Kourtney show you the raw chicken? You and your chef serve me raw chicken. Sal, I&amp;#39;m so sorry there&amp;#39;s nothing we could do but I could give you a free cheesecake that&amp;#39;s the best I could do. At that moment I felt that I was punched in the face and then was offer free cheesecake. I denied the free cheesecake. I said free cheesecake you going to give me a free cheesecake after you guys served me raw chicken I don&amp;#39;t want cheesecake. The manager Sal said well we could take your information down but there&amp;#39;s really nothing we could do we have to follow procedure we&amp;#39;ll follow up with you( the follow-up never happen it been a week).

Closing time on this particular evening was @ 11:00 pm.<br&gt;<br&gt;The atmosphere was low light and kind of romantic. Candles were burning at every table. We were seated at a two-person table which is the basis for my only real complaint of the evening - the table just wasn&amp;#39;t big enough to allow us eat what we ordered comfortably.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our waitress was extremely friendly, helpful, and attentive the entire time.<br&gt;<br&gt;We started with drinks - I had a beer and my wife had a Blueberry Mojito which she loved. So far so good - off to a very good start. <br&gt;<br&gt;To eat, we ordered the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps which are build-your-own style. What this means is that they arrive to you in parts - the lettuce, \u00a0chicken, sauce, carrots, cucumbers, etc. all come separate on the dish and you build your lettuce wrap yourself. I&amp;#39;d rather them come prebuilt but they were so good I didn&amp;#39;t care. The chicken they came with was seasoned and grilled to perfection. The three different sauces that were included tasted great and I used all three together. In total, we were each able to make about 4 lettuce wraps which was more than we expected. Great deal in my opinion.<br&gt;<br&gt;In addition to the lettuce wraps, we ordered the Skinny Shrimp Soft Tacos (skinny calorie-wise) and three very fat (by appearance) soft tacos came to our table. They were filled with lettuce (maybe cabbage), chicken, tomatoes, avocados, and maybe some other items. At this point we were almost too full from the lettuce wraps to pay close attention to what was inside. My wife ate one and I ate the other two. The soft tacos were very good but the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps were the star of the night.<br&gt;<br&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t order a main entree and were too full to order dessert (the reason we came lol). Let me add that before we ordered anything, we were given two types of bread (one dark and one light) and butter. The bread was delicious - the perfect combination of crust and softness.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, we were both really impressed. We have avoided this place for so long but really for no reason. We just always went to BJ&amp;#39;s instead. They have a very extensive menu and a full bar. Another complaint I have is that if I am in the mood to drink a beer and eat, their beer selection is quite slim.

So when I saw on the menu they had crab and spinach dip I thought how bad could this be - its the best of both worlds, right? Wrong. The dip tasted more like a seafood dip with cheese. The crab tasted &amp;#34;fishy &amp;#34; not like fresh crab taste. I don&amp;#39;t know if they mixed in the crab juice or added some shrimp, it just didn&amp;#39;t taste right. All night I&amp;#39;ve been praying and hoping that I don&amp;#39;t run into tummy problems later. <br&gt;<br&gt;My friend ordered hamburger sliders and the cheese triangles which is a play on the mozzarella sticks. The sliders were very good. The mozzarella triangles were really unique and tasty. My happy hour drink was the Cosmo which was very tasty overall it was a nice time but it was nice because I had great company. Had my girlfriend been a no show, I would have been very up set.

We met for lunch. We were seated quickly. Since she picked me up, I indulged in a refreshing pina colada. I may have had two..they were good. I was not super hungry, so ordered the Thai lettuce wraps. I was very impressed at the presentation. Fresh, vibrant ingredients to assemble the wraps. It had chicken satay pieces, carrots, noodles, sprouts and a few other things I forgot. Also came with three sauces..one was a peanut sauce..and two chili sauces..everything was flavorful. I ate some and packed up the rest which became a late night snack in my hotel room!<br&gt;<br&gt;Two days later after alot of motorcycle riding, I decided I would have brunch before I started the long ride home. It was a Sunday around noon. I was on my motorcycle and had to circle around the parking area a few times. They rope off a large section of parking in front of the restaurant next door to offer valet service. That was a bit annoying. I lucked out as someone pulled out of a spot in back! I decided to just sit in the high tables in the bar rather than wait for a regular table. It is open seating in bar. I had my motorcycle gear and helmet so was nice to get a table with extra chairs. <br&gt;<br&gt;I decided on the fried chicken and waffles. So glad I did! Delicious from start to finish. It was chicken tenders, perfectly battered..light and crispy and tender meat. The small waffle sections were perfectly light and had a little crisp to them as well. The home fry potatoes, which I usually hate at every restaurant that comes with a breakfast were GREAT. Just what I like. These were smaller bits of potato..I am not sure how they prepare them but was almost like they twice fried them...they were not greasy..but all perfectly crunchy and crispy. The dish came with maple butter to pour over the waffles...YUM! I am glad I do not live that close..I would be there every weekend and quickly weigh 400lbs eating that every weekend!

My last visit (New Year&amp;#39;s day) was terrible - not only due to the wait, but with the way the hostesses handled the situation as well. I walked in with my family and was told that a party of 9 (6 adults, 1 kid and two toddlers) would be a 20-30 minutes wait - we were okay with that. 40 minutes passed, and I noticed everyone (parties of 2-8) who&amp;#39;s been coming after us getting seated within 5-10 minutes. I went to ask the hostess if our table would be ready soon, because a lot of people who&amp;#39;s come in after has already been seated to which she replied that we will be seated within 5 minutes as &amp;#34;they&amp;#39;re cleaning up your table right now.&amp;#34; 10 minutes: nothing. After waiting for 20 minutes when she said 5, my sister went up there again. Then the hostess told her that the server was on her break and that she&amp;#39;s going to seat us in 5 minutes for sure. Welp, another 10 minutes passed and my father walked out. My sister told the hostess that this was unacceptable and by then the party that walked in at the same time as we did had already finished their meal and left. Then she said, &amp;#34;well, your table was ready. We&amp;#39;re just waiting to seat you, but we can seat you right now if you wait a bit.&amp;#34; Our question was if our table has been ready as she said, why did she have to wait to seat us, yet kept seating everyone that came after us. The toddlers were complaining that they were starving so we left elsewhere and was helped right away despite the other restaurant being packed.<br&gt;<br&gt;Being a server for a decade myself, I was trying to be understanding of the whole situation and with the wait especially since it was New Years. However, it seems like no one at the front of the house really cared or know what they were doing anyway.

I looked at it and they charged $8.50 for our strawberry cheesecake (no, we didn&amp;#39;t need to add to our body&amp;#39;s abundant fat reserves but it was my parent&amp;#39;s anniversary). Yet all their menus showed the price was $7.95. <br&gt;<br&gt;So I told the waitress I knew it was splitting hairs but it&amp;#39;s the principle of the thing and she understood that and went and talked to her manager.

I told her no and she went and told the manager. The manager came back and told us the same thing.<br&gt;<br&gt;First off, this shouldn&amp;#39;t have been an issue to begin with; they should have correct pricing on all their menus at all times. Second, they should have corrected the error for us immediately. Third, you should never tell a customer some excuse and still make the customer responsible for it. I told him as such and he just looked at me and shook his head as if to say &amp;#34;sorry you don&amp;#39;t like it but tough luck we won&amp;#39;t change it for you.&amp;#34; Sure enough, they didn&amp;#39;t change it on the bill they brought back.

A few months ago a friend and I went to eat here. Her and my favorite appetizer is the avocado eggroll plate. We ordered a plate of them but were told they were out of avocado even though we saw other plates of food being served with avocado. It must have been another issue with the eggrolls themselves but either way we were very disappointed. Now some background - I live a half hour away from this Cheesecake Factory so to go there is a special trip. A week later I called and asked specifically if they now had avocado eggrolls in stock and available to order to go. The person on the phone said &amp;#34;we sure do!&amp;#34; very confidently. So I took a trip down there, I went in and went to the to go counter to order, and they told me they still didn&amp;#39;t have them available. This had me steaming. Obviously no one in this restaurant commmunicates with each other. Well I went home and wrote a complaint through the website. A while later I got an apology letter and a gift card from the manager. I figured at this point that at least the communication problem would have been addressed. So a week later I call, and I ask the same thing. They tell me the same thing they did when I called before: &amp;#34;we sure do have them available!&amp;#34; Well guess what? I drive down there and they&amp;#39;re still unavailable. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE!? You can probably guess how upset I was, and of course I complained online again. I didn&amp;#39;t get a response for a couple of months in the form of a letter from the manager asking me to call him. Well I kept calling and every day someone told me that he had &amp;#39;just&amp;#39; left. Yeah right.

When it came time to clear plates and bring the bill she saw that most was still on my plate n took it.. when she came back she was profusely apologetic that she examined what was left on my plate n yes definitely it was overcooked n over breaded n so she removed it from my tab. N offered to replace it with anything else on the menu at no charge! I declined and paid the tab but then im assuming the manager came over and profusely apologized also and made the same offer of replacing my meal at no charge!

Last night was my son&amp;#39;s 18th birthday and for some odd reason he chose to want to have dinner at Cheesecake Factory. We were a party of 9 (7 adults and 2 preteens.) At this point we have been waiting at least 15 to 20 mins which is not unreasonable so my wife and I chose to head to the bar and get cocktails before we were seated. As we see our party getting escorted to our table we noticed it was a table for a party of 8. So we informed the hostess that we needed a table for 9. Unfortunately, she was insisting that 9 people can fit even though there was only a setting for 8 with no room to put a 9th person anywhere. We insisted that she find us a table for 9. She was walking around for several minutes and with no success she claims she could not find a table for us when it shows it was not a busy night when numerous tables were open. We asked for the manager on duty and my wife spoke to him. After stating our concern he informed us that we can either wait longer because there is no table available for 9 people despite numerous tables being open or we can walk out. This manager&amp;#39;s name is Brian, at least that is what he claims it to be. Very unprofessional. Not a good way to keep customers wanting to come back. Needless to say we ended up celebrating my son&amp;#39;s 18th birthday elsewhere. Cheesecake Factory lost at least 7 repeat customers and for that evening lost over $300 in revenue. If this is how Cheesecake factory chooses to treat its customers consider this individual and family never to return to any cheesecake factory. I hope corporate leaders look at this incident seriously and not just brush it under the rug like what most huge corporations do. Mr. Jose Jimenez, if you truly care about customer service you need to deal with this shift manager and show him how to deal with customers professionally and not be a pompous ass.

We sat ourselves at the bar to get a seat right away, we didn&amp;#39;t care for the 30 minutes wait time for a table (by the way, Sunday after church, lunch time, is the worst time to come in!!). Our tall, dark-haired bartender/waiter was very forth-coming &amp;amp; pleasant. He gave us service right away &amp;amp; served my husband his drink immediately. We ordered lunch specials &amp;amp; had a basket of bread as we waited for our meal. <br&gt;Ok...here is the run down: we arrived around 1:30 p.m. Sat at the bar &amp;amp; placed our order by 1:40 p.m. I was watching the Chicago Bulls vs. LA Clippers game, 3rd quarter in. I&amp;#39;m enjoying the moment with my husband as the time flies, making plans for vacations and so forth.<br&gt;*********<br&gt;So its the end of the game (the Clippers won by the way), we had our second basket of bread &amp;amp; butter. My husband had to limit himself with a second beer, since he was driving and its 3:00 p.m. (-_-) ONE HOUR AND SOMETHING MINUTES FOR OUR FOOD. Wait, let me be honest because I&amp;#39;m rounding off the time, maybe it was 2:58p.m. for our food to actually arrive. <br&gt;I do have to point out that the bartender/waiter was courteous &amp;amp; kept his actions professional, but it doesn&amp;#39;t justify why our food took forever to come out! You would think we would get a discounted price on our meal...nope.<br&gt;*********<br&gt;As for the meal overall: I ordered the &amp;#34;Pasta Shrimp &amp;amp; Sausage&amp;#34; plate, my favorite! My twist into this meal is I prefer angel hair pasta instead of the rigatoni that it comes with. Why you may ask; well I like the texture of the angel hair &amp;amp; I feel like the rigatoni takes away focus of the meal--which I believe the shrimp &amp;amp; sausage should be the main highlight of the plate. And yes, I&amp;#39;ve ordered this before so I know what I am getting myself into. Usually with this plate, the meal is super hot to eat right away &amp;amp; the steam is literally rising from the sauce. Well, it wasn&amp;#39;t--I was able to scarf half of this plate down by 3:15 p.m. Same goes for my husband, he ate his macaroni burger, practically in one gulp. The sweet potato fries wasn&amp;#39;t fresh from the fryer and it didn&amp;#39;t have its usual crisp. So the food, honestly, for the price we paid, was not worth it at all. <br&gt;********<br&gt;Cheesecake: ordered the Chris&amp;#39; Outrageous Cheesecake. This is somewhat of a German chocolate cake wannabe. Not too bad and it was worth the try, but will not order again. Yes, we had our mind set on a cheesecake in the middle of our 1 hr and something minutes wait; so this was ordered right after our meal. From the variety I have had, this cheesecake doesn&amp;#39;t rank up into the top 10 category. <br&gt;********<br&gt;The incident: yes, something happened overall this unsatisfactory visit. So yes we&amp;#39;re human, we all make mistakes. Another waiter assisted us while our tall, dark-haired bartender/waiter stepped away for a few minutes. Well this waiter in particular, attended to us &amp;amp; happened to assist us with boxing away my pasta. He made a light conversation but he didn&amp;#39;t realize he wasn&amp;#39;t placing the pasta into the take-home box, rather than the bar counter top. Let me rephrase that: he was placing the pasta on top of the bar counter-top instead of the take-home box...*****let that sink in*****yes, I know, it was a mistake. My husband and I have a great sense of humor...so we laughed it off--this was not intentional, it was an honest mistake. I felt bad for the waiter, but he did offer a lunch-size special of the pasta to be taken home. I felt he was embarrassed for his actions (since he scooped up the pasta and didn&amp;#39;t clean up the remainder of the sauce on the counter-top, and continued serving the rest of the bar). As soon as our tall, dark-haired bartender/waiter returned, the other waiter disappeared. <br&gt;********<br&gt;The take-home product: yes I received my meal just how I wanted--with angel hair. But as I dug into it the next day, I noticed there was some rigatoni pasta noodles mixed in. No big deal but for such a high class restaurant, you would think something as simple as this shouldn&amp;#39;t happen. <br&gt;********<br&gt;The reasoning behind the two stars: <br&gt;*I didn&amp;#39;t take a star off w/the 2nd waiter who helped us because it was a mistake, even though we waited another 20 mins for the take-home pasta.*<br&gt;1. First star was taken off due to the wait-time of our food. It wasn&amp;#39;t our tall, dark-haired bartender/waiter&amp;#39;s fault because there are other servers that could have caught this. <br&gt;2. Second star was taken off due to the quality of our food. Please see the above details. <br&gt;3. Third star was taken off due to the take-home product. It wasn&amp;#39;t made from the chef&amp;#39;s heart. Going to a restaurant like this and paying the prices we pay for the outcome to be shitty, makes me wonder if the chef&amp;#39;s heart was in the right place to cook this food for me. <br&gt;<br&gt;Honestly...we should&amp;#39;ve went to Olive Garden for the overall experience.

My husband&amp;#39;s herb-encrusted chicken was alright, he enjoyed it, the mashed potatoes were plain, lacked seasoning, but the asparagus was delicious and very flavorful. I also ordered sweet potato fries with the yummy sauce on the side, and those were so yummy!! For dessert, we got the original cheesecake, and I was really looking forward to that first bite because I fugured it would be magical, but it was disappointing. For being named after cheesecake, I really expected more. Honestly, my mom makes better cheesecake. <br&gt;Now on to customer service, that I give them a 5/5.

We both ordered the same thing - Crusted Chicken Romano. SO GOOD! The chicken breasts are cut thin and crusted with cheese, the pasta comes with a light tomato sauce. Everything was delicious.

I&amp;#39;m not actually sure where I should start. \u00a0Let&amp;#39;s start when my group got seated. The booth was somewhat dirty, \u00a0menu smelled of &amp;#39;last night&amp;#39;s leftovers left on the counter all night&amp;#39; &amp;amp; my waitress was wearing black \u00a0jeans. I am not one to be upset by attire usually but since the service was so poor I think it should be noted. I ordered mint tea, wild mushroom soup and the miso salmon. The waitress kept refilling it with green tea. The soup was AMAZING as always. I will never tire of that soup &amp;amp; I&amp;#39;m always excited when it is the soup of the day. That is the only positive note. The miso salmon was too sweet today and the peas were dry. I decided my meal could be overlooked until the waitress asked me if something was wrong w my meal. I told her my issues with the meal and she just stared at me for a minute and then asks me if I want another one. I decline \u00a0which is when she offered me &amp;#34; another meal or something..&amp;#34; again I \u00a0declined and said thank you anyways. This is when my friend informed me her &amp;#39;medium rare&amp;#39; burger was in fact well done and then I noticed my spouse&amp;#39;s pasta meal was missing one of the main ingredients. She tends to be very passive when it comes to others so she hadn&amp;#39;t mentioned it until I asked where the garlic was. This is about the time the manager walks up to our table and asks about my plate. I explain to him my issues with my meal as well as the others. He told me he will go talk to the kitchen and he will be right back. \u00a0He never did come back.. though I did see him walk past our booth 3 more times. The waitress came back and says the miso salmon has been taken off the ticket. \u00a0I review the ticket pay with cash and silently vowed to never return to this restaurant as long as I live.

Nothing different about it, but deep after devouring a two cooked buffalo wings was a chicken drum blood. I didn&amp;#39;t say anything cause I lost my appetite. I left it to the side and hoped it would cook in the microwave, soften, but to cook the blood away. I just couldn&amp;#39;t say anything, I was upset. My sister&amp;#39;s buffalo wings was delish, but too oily to devour it. First of all, I thought it would be a small dish! ...but it wasn&amp;#39;t. It was too much our lunch arrived immediately.

Our server was great, but her shift ended and she came by our table to thank us and introduce us to the male server that would be taking over for her. By this time we were just about wrapped up, and when he came back to check to see if we needed anything else we all decided to order some cheesecake. After bringing our desserts, he brought all of our checks. We all paid with cards, and while everyone else left their tips on their card, my mom and I left $10 in cash on the table, and I wrote &amp;#34;Cash&amp;#34; on the tip line of the receipt and, brought the total of $47.51 down to the total line. Today I go to balance my checkbook and there was a $2.49 discrepancy between my check register and what the bank said my balance was. Upon speaking to a representative about one transaction, that did not match any receipt from the week I had balanced through, it was the debit from my visit to The Cheesecake Factory. It had posted for $50.00. I called and spoke to the manager, and he investigated it. When he called me back he confirmed, that I had indeed written &amp;#34;cash&amp;#34; in the tip line but for some reason the server, who only served our desserts, ran it through for $50.00, when it clearly should have been for the $47.51. He was apologetic, informed me he would credit my card back for the overcharge, and talk to the server about it. But, is that enough? I&amp;#39;m not upset about the $2.49, but the dishonesty the server showed in rounding up my tab. How much extra money does he get away with if he does it to every table he serves?

Well, I just finished taking a closer look at it, and it was raw! It was gooey because they just mixed the entire thing together, apple slices, cinnamon-flavored dough, walnuts. I put the whole thing in my oven and baked it for about 25 mins. It was a little bit better. By the way, the Asian tacos were good, though the chicken was a little dry.
