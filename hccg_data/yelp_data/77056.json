I had had little sleep and looked forward to getting home, eating and going straight to bed. <br&gt;<br&gt;I placed my order at 4pm and it took awhile to get a response it had gone through. The driver contacted me shortly after that she was at the restaurant and waiting for my food. She sat there waiting for an hour. This pisses me off, not because I had to wait, but she did. People do not work food delivery out of the kindness of their hearts. Times are tough and they are doing what they can to make ends meet. They have other jobs and do this in their spare time. She could have taken a couple orders in the time she was made to wait for mine and I find this incredibly inconsiderate of The Cheesecake Factory. <br&gt;<br&gt;I believe the problem is that of management and ownership. Staff better. Pay people better so they want to work for you and do a good job. If at 4pm you were backed up an HOUR for a single entree and already prepared dessert, you were understaffed and that is the fault of the owners and management. You wouldn&amp;#39;t do this to a customer in your establishment I would hope, so don&amp;#39;t do this to those ordering delivery paying the same damn amount. <br&gt;<br&gt;When I finally received my order around 5:30pm, the driver had actually called me to tell me she was on her way so I know it was not an issue on her part. When I received my delivery, there was no dessert. My food was cold. Far too cold for her drive over. The green beans weren&amp;#39;t even in my entree container at all. Nope. No green beans. My mashed potatoes were a hard glop of congealed mush. Had my food merely just been sitting in the window while the driver and I both waited? I don&amp;#39;t know. Maybe she held my container up to the a/c as she rushed it to me. Who knows. I know my food had no trace of warmth at all. <br&gt;<br&gt;My drink&amp;#39;s ice had already melted, I&amp;#39;m guessing it was poured early on and sat there and melted? So I had half and half soda and water. That wasn&amp;#39;t cold either. <br&gt;<br&gt;All of this leads me to believe that this is a serious management issue. Either they were very busy and understaffed or they have not properly trained staff to carry out basic restaurant duties to efficiently get a single entree out in under an hour.<br&gt;<br&gt;Yes, I get this is a popular place with hundreds of guests an hour. I totally understand that my food was not the only food that was prepared that day. Quantity should not affect quality though.

This review by no means is representative of the average experience there, but I just felt I had to share this in hopes that management sees this and does something about this mango situation they have going on. Last night I ordered the grilled chicken, avocado, and mango salad, and was SORELY disappointed by its quality. The dressing was whack af and the mango had something seriously wrong with it. I&amp;#39;ve never had mango I didn&amp;#39;t like before, but this shit honestLy didn&amp;#39;t even taste like mango. It&amp;#39;s obviously frozen and thawed out but something must have gone wrong in this process because that shit was straight up NASTY. I also have felt queasy today and I can&amp;#39;t help but think that messed up mango had something to do with it. Mango has always been mY favorite fruit but just the thought of it is enough to make me nauseous \u00a0right now because of my experience last night. I love Cheesecake Factory and theY have many great dIshes but that salad needs to go. If they don&amp;#39;t want to straight up get rid of it, they need to switch up that dressing and start using fresh \u00a0mango.

You can do better Cheesecake Factory... please fix this <br&gt;I am actually at the granny luxe cafe right now o because I \u00a0needeD to renew my faith in this company. It&amp;#39;s working.

Want to experience the hilarity of this review? Just go the Cheesecake Factory Galleria location! <br&gt;<br&gt;My mom and I decided to meet one day for lunch here. It&amp;#39;s a rare occasion, so we were pretty excited about the time to spend enjoying lunch.<br&gt;<br&gt;I got to the restaurant first, and pretty early. I was sitting outside the restaurant in the small waiting area and a manager (I got his name, and I want to say that it was David, but *disclaimer* that might be totally incorrect, however that is what I will call him for the sake of this review. Either way, he was bald, about 5&amp;#39;11&amp;#34;, and light skinned with an accent.) approached me and asked me &amp;#34;can I help you?&amp;#34; Sort of arrogantly. I said &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; just as arrogantly back. He looked at me like he was offended, and I thought to myself, &amp;#34;well, I&amp;#39;d be offended too.&amp;#34; But I kept that thought to myself and told him &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m waiting on someone.&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;While I was waiting, I noticed there was a gift card promotion going on - buy a gift card, get a free cheesecake. I approached the host stand to ask about it, but all I was able to say was &amp;#34;I have a question about the gift card promotion.&amp;#34; Before the hostess cut me off, and pointed to the to go counter and said &amp;#34;Gift cards that way.&amp;#34; And went back to tapping away on her little host screen. <br&gt;<br&gt;I begrudgingly went to the to go counter and got my answer about the gift cards, went back outside to sit, and waited for my mom. Once she got there, we went inside and were greeted by a much nicer hostess who walked us to our table. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our server, Tony, came and greeted us after a few minutes of us sitting there. He was a good server, I want to emphasize that. It wasn&amp;#39;t his fault about what happened next. <br&gt;<br&gt;He brought us butter and bread. Frozen butter. And cold bread. We were cool with the cold bread, but my mom couldn&amp;#39;t handle the frozen, unspreadable butter so she sent it back. When tony returned with the 2nd butter, it too, was frozen. She handed him back the butter, and the 3rd time he brought it, it was finally melted enough to spread.<br&gt;<br&gt;Then my mom received her coke. She could tell by tasting it that it was Diet Coke. She pulled Tony aside and asked him why he&amp;#39;d brought her a Diet Coke, and he said &amp;#34;how can you tell?!&amp;#34; Wow. Anyways, he went to the kitchen and came back a few minutes later to apologize to her and explained that &amp;#34;someone&amp;#34; in the kitchen had switched the connections between the coke nozzle and Diet Coke nozzle but that it was being fixed. He brought her a new coke once the machine was corrected. It was flat. 100% broke-down, on the side of the road, flat. <br&gt;<br&gt;We called over the manager, David, and he seemed like we disturbed him from his very busy shift. He nodded and acted interested while my mom told him about our experience thus far. He didn&amp;#39;t apologize, he made excuses. While we was making excuses to my mom, I was observing him, and I noticed something strange: he had on a rubber bracelet- the kind that are given out at events with words printed on them. His said in big bold white letters &amp;#34;Don&amp;#39;t be a little b*tch!!!&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;I interrupted his excuses and said to him &amp;#34;Nice bracelet.&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;ve never seen someone go so rigid and panicky as they came to the realization of their error. He slowly reached down to this wrist and turned the bracelet inside out. He nodded and remained speechless for the first time in minutes. I told him I&amp;#39;d once worked in the restaurant industry for quite some time, and that his behavior and presentation was completely unacceptable. He asked me &amp;#34;oh yeah? What restaurant?&amp;#34; Again, no apologies. He changed the subject to something that was irrelevant, and then he excused himself from the table. <br&gt;<br&gt;At the end of our meal, when Tony dropped off the check, I put my debit card in the check presenter. David came by quickly, took my debit card out, slid it towards me, and said &amp;#34;Sorry it didn&amp;#39;t go so well today.&amp;#34; And as he was walking off refusing to make eye contact with me, I heard him mutter &amp;#34;maybe next times better.&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry, but paying for my food doesn&amp;#39;t make me forget about the bracelet or the experience.

We have only been here together once since chain restaurants are not our jam. However, it was a pleasant dinner. Ambience-the lighting is low and warm. We were seated on a booth with other tables adjoining, but there are solo booths available. Bread is complimentary, and the brown bread is a winnerThe menu is giant. Massive. Enormous. We opted to split some small plates, which was PLENTY for two grown adults. The chicken samosas arrived first. They were flavorful and crisp. The accompanying sauce was tasty as well. Cuban egg rolls came next-they were not my fave. The mustard sauce was thin and the egg roll itself was not cohesive. But it was fine. Nashville nuggets were another small plate we sampled. They are not anything brand new-just chicken nuggets with hot sauce or Buffalo sauce. But they were tasty. The dish in last place was the truffle cheese sticks (bacon truffle cheese sticks? Something like that). Avoid. It was just grease. Flavorless grease. &amp;#34;Flavorless Grease&amp;#34; is a great name for a band. Terrible when it describes your food. So overall, our small plates were fine. What brings this review up to 3 stars were the speedy and attentive service as well as the cheesecake. Red Velvet cheesecake. So light, so delicious.

So, let&amp;#39;s do this: lemme get excited about The Cheesecake Factory. First, I do love going to The Galleria for anything. So, next time, I won&amp;#39;t be so cheap and deny myself valet service. I decided to park underground and hoof it up a flight of stairs, then another inside the mall ( yup, the escalators were out of service. of course the day I wear high heels. all in the name of sexy heels). Ok, so here&amp;#39;s the skinny on the fat-laden Cheesecake factory:<br&gt;<br&gt;Pros:<br&gt;1. In the mood for something off the menu? Don&amp;#39;t hesitate to ask. My BFF was dying for some particular &amp;#34;brunch-only&amp;#34; grilled skirt steak and our server pulled some strings to get her exactly what she wanted despite us not being there during brunch. So thank you cool server for hooking us up!<br&gt;2. The white and dark brown oat bread is warm and delicious with butter. OMG what I won&amp;#39;t do for a warm bread basket. <br&gt;3. Ask for a mango juice spritzer: half of their mango juice with seltzer. You&amp;#39;ll thank me later, in case you end up diving in for a bite or three of cheesecake.<br&gt;4. If you go during lunch, order from their lunch menu. Smaller portions with 2 sides and a smaller price ($11.99). I got the meatloaf with broccoli and sweet potato fries. 2 slices of tasty loaf, with \u00a0a little on the mushy side broccoli and perfectly salty sweet SP fries. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;Cons:<br&gt;1. If you sit on the patio upstairs, be sure to bring your sunglasses. You swear you were on the Love Boat &amp;#39;s Lido Desk. It gets super bright. Note: Vampires, sit inside. <br&gt;2. Bathroom is downstairs only. Ladies, if wearing \u00a0heels, be prepared to take the elevator or walk down 1 flight of stairs. <br&gt;3. Nothing truly exceptional here. The service is hit or miss: you won&amp;#39;t get extremely friendly service or any special recommendations. <br&gt;4. In my opinion, the cheesecakes here look impressive, but I&amp;#39;m more of a fan of smaller portions and lighter tasting cheesecakes. So for that reason, I can only warrant 3 stars. <br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, if you&amp;#39;re dining with someone who loves The Cheesecake Factory or a group with diverse tastes, their menu is perfect.

We see her walk to the place where they&amp;#39;re cooking, thinking she or someone would bring us some but nope.

I did ask our waitress to get me another side of mashed potatoes and I was like... if she charges me for this I will explode. But at least the burger my fiance got was good. I ordered a slice of chocolate cake to go cause i didn&amp;#39;t want to be there any longer, and when i opened to eat it in the car it was this thin slice.

I tried to attract his attention, but after 5 minutes back in my seat, no sign of the manager.

I know they were busy, but a polite &amp;#34;excuse me&amp;#34; with a smile would have accomplished her goal. The slight shove paired with an irritated expression wasn&amp;#39;t necessary.

Two of the bathroom stalls were covered with diarrhea, and one toilet was in a state of overflow. No stall had any usable toilet paper, but the floors were covered with used toilet paper. There was no soap or paper towels. Obviously the customers behaved badly for the restrooms to reach that point, but it is the staff&amp;#39;s responsibility to keep it from reaching this point. <br&gt;<br&gt;Problem 3 - The macaroni and cheese that we ordered for the kids was undercooked to the point of being crunchy. Not al dente, CRUNCHY. Our French fries were terrible; they were cold and tasted old. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Pros - The service was good. We liked the brown bread and the iced tea. The children&amp;#39;s pizza was pretty good, and they liked it. Our mushroom sandwiches were good enough to order again. I enjoyed the Oreo cheesecake. <br&gt;<br&gt;In summary, I&amp;#39;m not interested in going back to this location. We waited 45 minutes for a nasty hostess, a disgusting bathroom, and mediocre food.

Service sucks. OVERPRICED.<br&gt;<br&gt;I have been to 3 Cheesecake Factories: Sugar Land years ago when it opened (was okay), The Woodlands ( a couple years ago. did well for seating/serving our large party, but we had to sit outside in the cold with only some heaters working) aaaand this one.<br&gt;<br&gt;We put our name down at about 3:30, and finally sat down at 4. Never have I been to a restaurant so full during the slowest hours of the restaurant day.<br&gt;<br&gt;First off, it&amp;#39;s pretty small as these places go. There&amp;#39;s two stories and they way the seating is, it&amp;#39;s not a favorable floor plan if the stairs are right in the middle. looks cool, but takes up a lot of space. The downstairs/main/valet entrance has no space for how many people have to wait. I guess you could stand around on the sidewalk if you had to. We always had to shift around when someone was passing by. The upstairs/mall entrance is a bit better, and there are more benches just outside to sit on, or you could line the long hallway.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our buzzer goes off, and the upstairs hostess informs us that we need to go the DOWNSTAIRS host stand to be seated. we do so. host informs us that table is being cleaned still...<br&gt;<br&gt;10 minutes later and the table is JUST getting cleared off. Host sets places and we sit. Menu is huge - there is a huge poster outside the mall entrance of everything they serve. Quite daunting if you were as hungry as we were. Weird thing is, there were apparently 2 menus with no obvious labels of their differences until you saw one had more options (I think one was lunch and the other dinner) and one is full (every other page) of advertisements.<br&gt;<br&gt;10 MORE minutes later and we finally get a waiter to take our drink &amp;amp; appetizer order and to request some bread.<br&gt;<br&gt;probably another 10 minutes until our drinks come, though he&amp;#39;s standing around talking to one table while holding our and our neighboring table&amp;#39;s drinks for a few minutes. Aren&amp;#39;t you supposed to drop off all the drinks, and if one table is ready to order, say &amp;#39;let me drop these off&amp;#39; and I&amp;#39;ll come back? He was taking so long I was contemplating just getting up and taking our drinks off his tray since he was standing 5 feet away.<br&gt;<br&gt;So recap if you&amp;#39;re still with me: we have been waiting about an hour for any food or drink.. still no bread and that&amp;#39;s supposed to come with your drinks, or shortly thereafter.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our appetizer finally comes. spinach artichoke dip with little bowls of pico and sour cream. decent, nothing special or horrible. Still no bread, though he brings the couple beside us their bread. They were seated after us.<br&gt;<br&gt;Food comes - WITH the bread! We had specifically asked for it first because we were really hungry. okay, whatever, our food is here. One friend asks for ketchup. Waits well over 5 minutes for it, and our drinks have not been refilled this whole time. They&amp;#39;re all half ice, and with the appetizer we&amp;#39;ve sucked them down already. Friend calls over manager to complain. We feel kinda bad but... this is really slow. Ridiculously so.<br&gt;<br&gt;Other friend seems to be enjoying her greek salad and avocado eggrolls. My chicken carbonara was underseasoned, and I had to pay an extra $2.50 for a measly chicken breast. The pasta was okay, but maybe I&amp;#39;m just getting too critical. In my opinion, DEFINITELY NOT worth what I paid, which was over $15. The dish shouldn&amp;#39;t have cost more than maybe 12 total.<br&gt;<br&gt;So now the manager and the waiter have combined their efforts and it probably equaled to about 1 lackluster server.<br&gt;<br&gt;We finish and we had explained at the beginning of the meal that we wanted to split the dip 3 ways, and then the rest of the ticket billed to each person, respectively. He had to ask again. Took over 10 minutes to split it. We get the books back and he hadn&amp;#39;t even run already peeved friend&amp;#39;s card, and put the other friend&amp;#39;s ticket with his card. Then we had to wait for him to do that... it&amp;#39;s 5PM at this point. took this long without wine/dessert?!<br&gt;<br&gt;FINALLY we left. I vow to never return here for a meal. Maybe only if they ever get that Toblerone cheesecake again.. and I&amp;#39;ll eat it at the bar to take it to go.<br&gt;<br&gt;Horrible - and not even on a busy night! And this was not an isolated incident.. the other 2 tables beside us had the same time-laden service as well. The first couple wanted to get dessert, but the waiter was taking so long they couldn&amp;#39;t wait any longer and asked for their bill after they only had an appetizer. The other table was agreeing with us. And we wished the new couple who sat down before we left luck with a more expedited service.

That being said, the food AND the service is not worth what the menu says it is. I ordered the spicy crispy chicken sandwich this time and I could have sworn I was eating a fast food sandwich.

Second, the waitress drops my fries when bringing my food. Not such a big deal since they offered to get me fresh ones. Third, they brought me BLUE CHEESE instead of mayo for my sandwich. I had already started spreading it on the top half of my bun by the time I had realized something was awry, but the manager offered to get me a fresh top bun for my sandwich. Fourth, I never received the onions I asked for when I initially ordered the sandwich. Fifth, on more than one occasion I had to call the waiter over to get a refill of water.

Then 15 min go by and we asked another server and she was like well we are waiting for a party to leave so you can have that table. So that got me really upset cause seemed like they were giving us random answers.
