This Factory of cheese and cake has been around for 12 years, and it won&amp;#39;t be leaving the Americana anytime soon. <br&gt;<br&gt;But, I choose to review it all the same. I cannot say I am a fan. To put it simply, I am always wary of restaurants that try to do too many things at once. Cheesecake is the poster child of this shotgun approach to cuisine. If it&amp;#39;s a food on Earth, it has probably lived on a Cheesecake menu at some point. And that&amp;#39;s exactly my issue. The result of trying to make too many different kinds of foods is that none of them end up being very high quality. Sure they have decent appetizers, yes they have a variety of entrees and salads and desserts, but I would much rather go to a Yard House or BJ&amp;#39;s. Cheesecake just feels too commercial, too chintzy. I only really come to the CF when my wife forces us to because she adores it with a reverence that boggles my brain.<br&gt;<br&gt;On top of allll that, years ago the Center for Science in the Public Interest named the CF the winner of its Xtreme Eating survey. This is one accolade I&amp;#39;m sure the Factory doesn&amp;#39;t want you knowing about. At the time, Cake of Cheese had 3 of the 9 most calorie-laden dishes in the country. In fact, I&amp;#39;m sure if you browse with a careful eye, you&amp;#39;ll see the behemoth calorie cows on the menu ALL over the place. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never had any issue with the staff, nor have I found anything obscenely wrong with my meal, but Cheesecake is one restaurant I will gladly give a hard pass, whenever I can.", "rating": 2, "date": "3/10/2020"}, {"text": "My sister was in town and my family wanted to celebrate by going to the Cheesecake Factory. We went on a Monday night at 6:00 p.m. and were surprised by the 30-minute wait because I&amp;#39;ve been multiple times during a work week and the wait has been very minimal, if any. I understand that wait times will vary, but I wanted to provide context because by the time we were seated at 6:30 p.m., we had to wait another 15-20 minutes for someone to take our order at 6:50 p.m., and then another 45 minutes for our meals to come at 7:45 p.m.! It took almost 2 hours to begin to eat. At this time, it was already getting late and we were hungry. So just to emphasize, the waiter takes our order at 6:50 p.m. 30 minutes pass by and we still haven&amp;#39;t received our food. Then it&amp;#39;s 45 minutes later and still no food. It&amp;#39;s completely not acceptable and something is wrong if we come at 6:00 p.m. and we don&amp;#39;t eat until almost past 8:00 p.m. That is absolutely crazy. <br&gt;<br&gt;The worst part is when parties who arrive significantly later than us start receiving their meals before us. That is one of my biggest pet peeves. I had noticed that other parties were getting their orders taken right away and the food was served right after. It was terribly not consistent. What&amp;#39;s worse is that no one checked-in with us. WTF. The waiter checks-in with other tables and not us. I was most annoyed when 30 minutes pass by and the other tables who arrived after us are already wrapping up their meals. It should not haven taken 45 minutes since we placed our order--period. I had to express to the wait staff that this is way too long to be getting our food. I had ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken and my family had ordered a simple Caesar salad and Chinese chicken salad, but it should not have taken 45 minutes to make a salad! My chicken was also a lot tinier than in my previous visits. At this point, we were all hungry after a long day and we just wanted to eat and leave.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, it was completely unacceptable and there was nothing to remedy our situation. It left a really sour taste in my mouth and makes me not want to go back to Cheesecake Factory or recommend this place to anyone.

I really appreciate when restaurants have accurate wait times. We were sat with Puja G. and we are so grateful she was our server. <br&gt;<br&gt;We understand how long it may take for drinks and food to be ready during the holidays so we tend to be more patient. We ordered tea and a martini. The tea was immediately delivered because our server prepares it. The martini took a bit longer which is understandable. <br&gt;<br&gt;We then ordered the ahi tuna tartare to start off with and we then split the shrimp scampi. <br&gt;<br&gt;The shrimp scampi arrived before our appetizer. As bad as we felt about returning the main plate until our appetizer arrived we had to. I can&amp;#39;t imagine having a pasta plate followed by the ahi tuna tartare. Puja very politely explained she did place our appetizer first but the main plate unfortunately arrived before. However, she made sure to fix the whole mistake swiftly. She brought out our appetizer. As soon as we finished the scampi plate was brought out. Both plates were great, we had tried the shrimp scampi plate before. <br&gt;<br&gt;It was our first time trying the ahi Tuna tartare and it was so great!! Very light and delicious. <br&gt;<br&gt;At the end of our meal PUJA G. came up to us and gifted us a loaf of their brown bread. She apologized for the timing mishap and told us she noticed how much we loved the brown bread and was more than happy to give us a loaf to apologize. We found her initiative so inspiring. She truly understands the meaning of what amazing customer service is! It does not mean flawless timing. It means caring and sympathetic service. <br&gt;<br&gt;Puja is an amazing addition to the Cheesecake Factory company.

Order was ready at 4:30 but since it was so poorly disorganized couldn&amp;#39;t get to the cashier until 5! So not only did I pay almost $200 but I have to eat cold food!?! This is not the workers fault but very bad management. Sucks our Mother&amp;#39;s Day was disappointing and didn&amp;#39;t get quality food. <br&gt;Who wants to eat a cold steak? A cold salmon!?! <br&gt;<br&gt;At times like this, we try to be understanding but with the amount of ppl crowding the place I was very anxious and now nervous as some ppl did not even have masks on and again no manager in site to tell them they can&amp;#39;t be here without it.

I will not frequent it as much because of their removal of the shrimp and bacon club sandwich. I mean, it was the BEST SANDWICH EVER! Had to get that off my chest. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now, about the Glendale location. It&amp;#39;s situated in a pretty convenient spot inside of The Americana.

From the hosts/hostesses to the busboys/girls, I&amp;#39;ve always had hospitable experiences at this location.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Food: Because they no longer have my favorite sandwich, I had to try something ELSE on the menu, my ongoing dilemma with each visit. This time, I tried their Chicken Parmesan (CP) sandwich with extra cheese and extra sauce. OH, MY GOODNESS!! This sandwich was much bigger than expected. Actually, way bigger than expected and GOOD! It wasn&amp;#39;t good enough to replace my love for their shrimp and bacon club sandwich but it was indeed a close 2nd!!! VERY CLOSE!! My friend kept asking me, &amp;#34;Are you going to finish all of that?&amp;#34; I finally told her, &amp;#34;I will make it my sole goal to finish TONIGHT! This can&amp;#39;t be reheated and taste the same.&amp;#34; I also ordered their Crispy Crab Bites. They are SO good. However, if I plan to order the CP sandwich again (and I do), I will not order the crab bites. I need all stomach space possible. <br&gt;<br&gt;The CP sandwich isn&amp;#39;t so big in size as much as it is in girth. They give you two chicken patties so that&amp;#39;s a lot of meat between two non-thin pieces of bread. THANK YOU and I am NOT complaining about this sandwich. The side salad was a joke, to say the least. I tried to eat the side salad but ummm, it was just a waste of greenery. <br&gt;<br&gt;I asked for extra sauce because I expected the sandwich to be a little dry. Oh, to my surprise, it was nothing near dry. So moist. I hardly touched my extra sauce on the side. The extra cheese added to the moistness and the ooey gooey with each bite. Yep, HAPPY!

She was told to use the Yelp page to make a reservation for 6 people (since that was the max available through Yelp) then the day of the reservation, just let the person at the front know the reservation is actually for 12 people. Sounds like a plan and a reservation was set for 6pm. Upon arrival, the line was so long that it was almost out the door. By the time I put my name in to claim the reservation, it was a little after 6pm. I was told by the girl at the front and the manager that they would NOT honor the reservation for 12 people even though my friend had spoken to the manager. The manager we spoke to that evening said that was a lie and none of their managers would say that. It&amp;#39;s Saturday night. I understand it&amp;#39;s busy but I could have done without the condescending tone. The agreement was that we would just have to make 2 reservations for 6 people and there was no way we could sit together. Half of my party was running late anyways so the first 6 sat together in the bar area. There was a table to my right that could have easily accommodated the remainder of my party but the manager was adamant that we could not have that table also.

My boyfriend and I are HUGE fans on The Cheesecake Factory, always dine-in, but due to the circumstances we have been just doing pick-up. Recently they announced outdoor dining and we decided to give it a go. On our way, we decided to call to inquire about the wait time. When they said 2-2.5 hours, my jaw dropped. I was in complete disbelief, but we both agreed that we weren&amp;#39;t starving and with the restaurant being in the Americana, we agreed to just come in, put our names down and go for a walk. As expected, the woman at the front told us what we already knew, 2 hour wait. We put our name and number down and left. Upon the 1.5 hour mark, I decided to call the restaurant and ask how much longer when someone abruptly answered the phone and was extremely abrasive with me. I was totally stunned and EAGER to get in there to speak to a manager. Quickly after we were called to be seated and what do you know, the one on the phone who I couldn&amp;#39;t wait to speak to the manager turns out to be the manager, go figure. Anywho, my boyfriend and I proceeded to speak to him about our concerns and he was just extremely apologetic, SUPER polite and attentive with us. I know \u00a0a lot of people are under tons of stress due to the insane circumstances we&amp;#39;re in, but LEE (manager) handled it very well and very professional. The waiter (didn&amp;#39;t get his name) was also great! Lee definitely left an impression on us. He needs a raise ASAP.

On the second request, he advised us that it was broken. We then asked a host if we could be moved near one that worked, and he quickly accommodated us. <br&gt;<br&gt;Although the new table was only 2 tables away from the one we left, we were now in another server&amp;#39;s (Sonya, I believe) station. Here&amp;#39;s where it went off the rails. She took forever to come to the table. The food was served. She finally greeted us and we ordered another round of cocktails. We requested some hot sauce and a wedge of lemon. Then almost immediately we were introduced to Alex, who would be taking over for Sonya. <br&gt;<br&gt;The drinks took about 20+ minutes to arrive and one was wrong, but we kept it since we didn&amp;#39;t want to wait again.

Let me start from the beginning. <br&gt;<br&gt;It was about a week ago and it was my grandma&amp;#39;s birthday. We asked her where she wanted to eat and she said Cheesecake Factory in Glendale. First thought that came to mind was the dirty silverware, plates, cups, and everything else that I see EVERY SINGLE TIME I go there. My brother and I told our parents that we didn&amp;#39;t want to go here because of our previous experiences and didn&amp;#39;t want to experience this on my grandma&amp;#39;s birthday, especially.

As soon as I was telling him about it, our buzzer rang. No turning back now. We get seated outside for a table of 5.<br&gt;<br&gt;First thing I do is check my silverware. And not to my surprise, my fork had a ketchup stain on the back of it and the silverware was dirty. There were stains all over it, like it usually was every single time we went. The silverware was like this for 3/5 people. We told our waiter and he told us that he would bring us PLASTIC forks, knives, and spoons. PLASTIC. Sorry, but if a waiter goes straight to fixing your utensil problem from silverware to PLASTIC then he should already know there is a problem and knows none of them will be clean no matter how many he gives us. That is problem #1. We accept it because we know this is the cleanest resort.<br&gt;<br&gt;My brother and I already complaining to leave, our parents and grandma told us that it was fine and that we should just enjoy it. Not for long. <br&gt;<br&gt;My brother opens up his napkin and a pasta noodle is stuck to it. Obviously not washed. First off, that is disgusting and you don&amp;#39;t have the time to thoroughly wash your utensils AND napkins? Ridiculous. <br&gt;<br&gt;My brother asks for another napkin and our waiter brings out another napkin. He opens it and there are LIPSTICK STAINS all over the napkin. I&amp;#39;ve had enough at this point and lost my appetite. It was already 1PM and I hadn&amp;#39;t eaten anything all day and already felt sick.

After getting our appetisers after 25 minutes, I decided to eat a little bit or else I was going to pass out. My mom is getting some of the artichoke dip and putting it in her plate. To her surprise, she thought there was an artichoke heart in the bowl and decided to cut it. But it wasn&amp;#39;t. It was a PIECE OF PAPER INSIDE THE DIP.<br&gt;<br&gt;That was it. We were done and we demanded to see the manager. We showed him everything and he didn&amp;#39;t flinch one bit. He just nodded and said &amp;#34;Yeah I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry&amp;#34;.

Probably a few more I&amp;#39;m forgetting at the moment.<br&gt;<br&gt;The wait times can get long on the weekends. When majority of restaurants now use the texting system, I don&amp;#39;t like how they give you a buzzer at this location so you can&amp;#39;t walk around too far while you wait. They do validate for Americana parking. Service has always been good. Regardless of the average rating, CF is like a staple that I&amp;#39;ll be returning to due to its a popular choice among friends and it having something for everyone.<br&gt;<br&gt;Also, their tuxedo cheesecake is the best cheesecake I&amp;#39;ve ever had.", "rating": 3, "date": "1/3/2018"}, {"text": "Great place.

I figured Monday&amp;#39;s they don&amp;#39;t have as many servers, so we waited with no hesitation. Our night took a bitter turn when our server did not seem so pleased to take care of our table. I understand; Monday night, you might feel like you&amp;#39;re the only busy server in the restaurant, I noticed he did have other 4+ tops to take care of. But from the jump he had an unpleasant with our party. I understand certain issues may be out of his power, eg) kitchen getting backed up. However, we had waited 30 minutes to even place our food orders. The server forgot multiple of our guests drinks- not a problem, he eventually brought everyone&amp;#39;s. but then it also took exactly an hour to even receive our cocktail drinks in which we were finally receiving after walking out of the door. Not once did we get water refills, or any sort of update/apology for the (unusual) Monday night delay. Waiting an hour without receiving anything besides one glass of water makes things very irritating and impatient, especially with 4 children in our group. When we decided to notify management and our server since we had not received anything, that we decided to leave instead, the server then tried to make our party feel wrong for our time we claimed we had waited. Forgive us for not getting as technical with you- 1.5hr wait, and a 1 hour wait after being seated to receive DRINKS on a moderate to slow monday night. We said 2 hours, but if we wanted to get technical it was damn near 3 hours. And no type of explanation or apology afterwards, his response was, &amp;#34;alright&amp;#34; and walked away. Other guests in our party said they notified the manager on duty of the issue and he seemed to have no knowledge on how to handle conflict. As someone who used to work hospitality in much more fast paced and nicer dining, I guess my expectations on conflict handling was too high for a chain place like the Cheesecake Factory. <br&gt;I tried to be understanding at first because I know the server is not the one in the kitchen cooking.

Sandwich and salad did not disappoint. Fresh deli turkey and mixed greens salad (no romaine lettuce) with vinaigrette.<br&gt;<br&gt;I inquired about happy hour and was told happy hour ends super early - I think from 4 to 6 pm or some early time like that. I asked for a Vesper but they had never heard of it. I told them it&amp;#39;s the 007 drink but I was not sure I wanted to try it if they didn&amp;#39;t know what it was. They had to look it up online (or somewhere internal) and was told they did not have one of the ingredients for one (they probably did not have the Kina Lillet aka Lillet Blanc)**. Feeling a bit defeated about the no, no, no (no happy hour, no vesper, no mezcal), I thanked the \u00a0bartender for asking me if I wanted something else -I told her I would not have ordered a drink had she not asked me.

Some people get complimentary bread auto; I asked for bread (squaw, sourdough baguette-like rolls). Since the soup was buttery, I asked for toasted bread slices or some bread crackers to buffer it. I got toasted bread slices but it literally took over ten minutes to get - to the point that I was almost done with the sandwich and salad and was offered a fresh, hot bowl of soup which I accepted.<br&gt;<br&gt;I paid with an AMEX gold card and received $10 off on my bank statement but paid full price at the restaurant.<br&gt;<br&gt;I felt the drink was a bit over-priced relatively speaking - a similar drink at the Nordstrom restaurant runs for about $10.

Bond only orders this drink once, ever. Others serve him the drink or versions of it (including once with vermouth) without his ordering it. He does not give the drink a name until he relates it to Vesper Lynd in the movie. Kina Lillet, a strong quinine bitter wine, is no longer made. Using tonic water would dilute the drink too much.

I asked other customers that looked confused about where I should go if I already paid online. They said probably outside. I use my cell phone to call the restaurant.

Then again, they used to think Sizzler was the bomb and they still eat steak well done... SMH....<br&gt;<br&gt;Look, I just don&amp;#39;t get why this place is so popular. Service is always shitty and wait times are almost always an hour or more for food that tastes no better than Stouffer&amp;#39;s frozen food. And honestly, I have no idea why they bother with Asian food that tastes worse than Panda Express. Trust me when I say the Teriyaki Chicken with Rice is just deplorable - I mean, it makes Mr. Yoshida&amp;#39;s sauce seem heavenly. My silly parents ordered this... uggh...<br&gt;<br&gt;And their shitty pizzas taste pre-packaged since they probably are shipped to the Cheesecake Factory from a Sysco-owned distribution warehouse. And speaking of pre-packaged, you should know that despite its name, none of the Cheesecake Factory restaurants actually make any cheesecakes in-house. All that is done in a &amp;#34;cheesecake factory&amp;#34; over in Calabasas. So if you really go to this restaurant for the cheesecake, just stop by the frozen section at your local Ralph&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s the same shit albeit a whole lot cheaper. <br&gt;<br&gt;And, as if to make your experience even more &amp;#34;cheesy&amp;#34; (pun intended), their menus are as thick as college readers.

Go spend your advertisement money on a bus bench &amp;#34;bro&amp;#34;. <br&gt;<br&gt;But the main reason I hate this place is because eating here is unhealthy and will take you one step closer to a heart attack since nearly every entr\u00e9e here is served with exorbitant amounts of sodium and fat.<br&gt;<br&gt;Take for instance the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic pasta dish consisting of bow-tie pasta, chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas and caramelized onions in a roasted garlic-parmesan cream sauce. This deceptively healthy sounding dish comes out to 2,190 calories, 58 grams of saturated fat (three day&amp;#39;s worth) and 1,830 milligrams (mg) of sodium. <br&gt;<br&gt;That is more than a Big Mac combo with a large Coke (1,580 calories) and two extra cheeseburgers (300 calories each). Moreover, the current dietary guidelines for Americans recommends that adults in general should consume no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day.<br&gt;<br&gt;And you know those &amp;#34;famous&amp;#34; Avocado Eggroll appetizers? One serving is 960 calories and contains 1,130 mg of sodium.

It&amp;#39;s a pretty nice shopping mall, with a similar vibe to the Grove, although there&amp;#39;s just something about the Grove that makes it a couple notches better. One downside though is having to pay a lot for parking (at both lol), unless you&amp;#39;re only there a few short hours and get your ticket validated (what I try to opt for -- not staying there like all day).

It&amp;#39;s simple, but yet there&amp;#39;s variety, and I like how they arrange it on a long plate and everything is in little sections (it&amp;#39;s not just like in a big bowl where everything is mixed together). 3/5<br&gt;<br&gt;SERVICE: The service is usually pretty good and reliable at most Cheesecake Factory locations, and this one isn&amp;#39;t excluded. 4/5", "rating": 3, "date": "1/14/2018"}, {"text": "The best Cheesecake Factory I always been to I always love coming her with my family never had a single issue here staff is very friendly and the food is very fresh and tasty", "rating": 5, "date": "5/27/2018"}, {"text": "I&amp;#39;m not one to ever come to American chained restaurants, but it was for a gf&amp;#39;s late bday dinner and she wanted something very simple and casual so what bday girl wants, bday girl gets haha.

You can park in the parking structure, and make sure to validate at the restaurant.<br&gt;<br&gt;The inside is pretty big, a bit dim on the lighting. Very casual and relaxed setting and a small bar area in the entrance. As you are seated they give you complimentary breads. I love the oat bread. It&amp;#39;s dark colored, like chocolate, and tasted sweet. Kind of remind me of the sweet oat bread from Subway. It comes out a tad warm and so soft. Along with some sourdough bread that is okay but not close to the oat bread. And lots of individual butter. We got another round of bread as we finished the first round first, and I must add it&amp;#39;s dangerous because I already started to get pretty full and it&amp;#39;s the perfect combo of carbs and sugar :)<br&gt;<br&gt;The menu is pretty big, they have such a huge selection and it&amp;#39;s great for families since they have something that everyone can enjoy, all with different taste.

Belgian Endive, Radicchio, Glazed Pecans, Blue Cheese and Vinaigrette. My gf usually gets this when she comes here, and I can see why. It&amp;#39;s a perfect small salad to start off with. The salad is refreshing but really carries and overpowering and pungent flavor from the blue cheese so make sure not to grab too much as a little goes a long way. Pairs nicely with the candied pecans, for some sweetness and balances well with the cheese and slight bitterness from the radicchio. All the ingredients go well together and the dressing is nicely sweet and tossed easily, which I appreciate.<br&gt;_Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Shrimp and Chicken Saut\u00e9ed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a Very Spicy Cajun Sauce. All on Top of Fresh Linguini. My 2 gf&amp;#39;s split this. I tried a bite and it was pretty good, but way too spicy for my liking. It had a real strong pepper aftertaste. The shrimp was nicely cooked and it seemed they put good amounts of it as well. Nothing amazing but if you like spicy this is a safe pasta dish. <br&gt;_Skinnylicious Soft Tacos. Three Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Spicy Chicken or Shrimp, Avocado, Tomato, Onions, Cilantro and Crema. Served with Escabeche Vegetables. I ordered this from the skinnylicious menu. I got chicken. It comes with all the toppings on the tacos but I asked for it all on the side. Good amount for 1 person or 2 to share. It was okay, I&amp;#39;ve had better tacos elsewhere, and was not really expecting much. The chicken was overcooked and dry and very bland in flavor. They barely gave enough toppings for all 3 toppings, especially the avocados, they really skimped on that. The best part of this dish was the escabeche vegetables. It was pickled cucumbers and cauliflower, that was refreshing sweet and acidic. <br&gt;_Tiramisu. Italian Custard Made with Mascarpone, Whipped Cream, Lady Fingers, Marsala and Coffee Liqueur. Topped with Whipped Cream and Ground Chocolate. Surprsingly, pretty good. I know it&amp;#39;s cheesecake factory but none of us were in the mood for cheesecake, but actually all agreed on tiramisu. It was great, but holly jeeeeeezzzz..... can you put any more whipped cream in the plate?! I couldn&amp;#39;t tell if the dessert was the whopped cream or tiramisu. One whip would have been enough. Nothing like taking a classic great dessert and smothering and over killing it with cheap american sugar. There was barely any ground chocolate as they mentioned.

The last time I saw a business this mismanaged, it was my nonexisting grandson&amp;#39;s snowball company. <br&gt;<br&gt;Once upon a time... <br&gt;<br&gt;On my first date with my boyfriend, we came out to the Americana, back on December 7, 2017. and let me tell you, the only romantic part of that date was the walk from the parking lot to the front doors of the cheesecake factory.

A bunch of anxious people, waiting to be discovered...by a god damn server. <br&gt;<br&gt;They give us a vibrating notice thingy and tell us the wait is 50 minutes. Well, we go walk around come back. nothing. We check in they&amp;#39;re like it&amp;#39;ll be a couple more minutes. let me be clear we had to stay there for an addition 45 minutes in the restaurant, every time checking in, they would tell us it will be a couple more minutes. Obviously we left after two hours, and I promised myself I&amp;#39;ll never go back. <br&gt;<br&gt;A few months later, I go in with a couple of friends, order food. I ordered some sort of flatbread or pizza, I recall. My friends order their burgers and a salad. aside from the terrible service, we all get a terrible stomachache and go back home, running to the bathroom. The survivors of the Great Plague might not have been able to survive that.<br&gt;<br&gt;On a separate occasion, I go back and put our names in. and have a few people come back in later. I specifically ask for a table outside, as the inside sounds like the gathering of a stadium of people, who are bad at hearing and are unanimously shouting at each other. we wait and wait for about half an hour. Until I go check-in, this girl at the reception says: &amp;#34;I mean yeah, meh, I can sit you inside right now.&amp;#34;. and I respond that I specifically asked for a table outside, for two.

We waited for around 5 mins, and was promptly seated. Our server Omar was very attentive and catered to one of our party food allergies very well. I ordered the beautiful Bruleed French Toast with bacon! Oh man this was a gorgeously tasty dish, especially after being drenched in maple syrup. To top it all off, I got myself a Bloody Mary!

Pretty much nothing better than warm fresh bread.<br&gt;<br&gt;About 15 minutes later two of our meals came out with the promise that my miso salmon was going to be ready in a few minutes. No biggie. I could wait a few more minutes. <br&gt;<br&gt;Over the next 20 minutes we were told three times that it would just be a few more minutes.

He did offer a free piece of cheesecake but it was really too little too late. <br&gt;<br&gt;I realize that the waiter had no control of the kitchen. What he should have done is apologize and get it taken care of. Instead, what he did was say he did what he was supposed to do but that it was someone else&amp;#39;s fault. You work as a team. When one of you fails, you all fail. There is no excuse for throwing someone else under the bus to try to protect yourself. It made the waiter appear unwilling to take responsibility. Honestly, we had no issue with the waiter until he said this. <br&gt;<br&gt;There is just no excuse for bringing out two meals before the third was ready.

We asked for the check and box for our leftover flatbread pizza, he took the plate to seem as if he was box it for us, but he he never brought it back. After paying we asked if he was going to bring us our leftover food, to find out that he threw it away. We then went to the cheesecake window to get two slices to go, we pay and wait for our slices. A couple in back of us ordered two slices as well and got them right away before us, we had to ask the workers for our slices we had already ordered and payed for.

I&amp;#39;m also a huge lover of cheese if you haven&amp;#39;t noticed yet, so I definitely had the waiter spend a couple of minutes covering my pasta with parmesan cheese. My pasta was basically covered with snow! To pair with the pasta, the complimentary bread is great with anything with a sauce-base. I especially enjoy their honey oat bread, which is what I crave most from The Cheesecake Factory. To end our meal, we shared the White Chocolate Macadamia Caramel Cheesecake ($7.95). I was a little disappointed with the cheesecake as the nuts were too much for me and lacked a true cheesecake texture.

Her name was Kelly B and she was very sweet, attentive, and overall one of the better servers that I have had while eating at this location. <br&gt;<br&gt;Of all the things I have eaten at Cheesecake, I will say one item on the menu sticks out to me and I get it almost every time. That is the dressing on the Santa Fe Salad (it is a Peanut-Cilantro Vinaigrette). It is very delicious and I typically ask for that dressing on almost any salad I order. Definitely recommend that dressing. <br&gt;<br&gt;One of the biggest problems I have had at Cheesecake Factory is when I adjust the specifications of a dish, it typically comes out wrong. I have no idea why? I find it hard to believe it&amp;#39;s the servers putting in the wrong order every time (that would be just too coincidental). I like to think it&amp;#39;s miscommunication either in the kitchen or with the expo/food runners. Whatever it is, I always expect my order to come out wrong if I change it up from what the menu has, so I pretty much try my best to either keep it very simple or just find an entree that doesn&amp;#39;t need any adjustments. For example, I gave up on ordering a burger with the exact ingredients that I like. It&amp;#39;s like the chef&amp;#39;s take a look at my burger order and say &amp;#34;well, that&amp;#39;s cute, but I think he&amp;#39;ll like this instead.&amp;#34; Nah... I just want my burger the way I asked please. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, the Cheesecake Factory can be a very hit or miss place with both food and service. The upside to the restaurant is that the menu is gigantic, so it&amp;#39;s perfect for a group of people who want different foods. It&amp;#39;s a nearly impossible feat to find somebody that wouldn&amp;#39;t like anything on the menu. I will probably always be dragged back here by friends/family just because the convenience of the large menu, but in reality, the Americana has so many better restaurants (in my opinion).", "rating": 3, "date": "12/27/2017"}, {"text": "This place used to be amazing, but I ordered some food to go tonight and the whole experience was awful.

Originally, my sister and I were going to have dinner at BACARI. But after half an hour of debating, we ended up going to Cheesecake Factory and I DEFINITELY REGRET it. We came at 3pm on a Saturday. There were 3 Hosts in the front. I immediately said Hello as we walked in. One of the hosts looked at me then looked away and chatted with the other two for a good minute. I was so confused! Was he blind? Did he really just ignore me? The two girls also did not acknowledge me and my sister. Finally, they took our name down (only waited for 5 mins for a table so yay) I brushed it off and told myself &amp;#34;Maybe our server will be nice&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;When we got to our table, there was NO high chair like requested. Host also told us to leave our stroller in the front once we got there. Uhm?? Why couldn&amp;#39;t you have told us that before we sat down. I&amp;#39;m not about to walk back to the front so we decided to leave it next to us. (WE NEVER GOT THE HIGH CHAIR UNTIL WE WERE ALMOST DONE EATING BTW)<br&gt;<br&gt;Fast forward - our server didn&amp;#39;t greet us for the first 10 mins or it seemed like. Also, he never checked up on us once we received our food. If he did, he would have known my sister never got parmesan cheese on her pasta because the lady that delivered it who was wearing a black dress clearly forgot. (Manager?) He also would known that we needed more napkins because my daughter spilled her water on the table. We cleaned it up ourselves which I don&amp;#39;t mind at all. But @ least give us new napkins! I don&amp;#39;t know how &amp;#34;busy&amp;#34; our server really was because he had enough time to check up on our neighbors. <br&gt;<br&gt;Finally, my sister had enough so she complained to him. He was not apologetic AT ALL. It seemed like he ignored us even more after that. But we didn&amp;#39;t let it bother us so we just continued to eat. Then we asked for our check and guess what? He made us wait toooo long for it. I had to stand up and look for him because my daughter was crying already. Such an unpleasant experience! I don&amp;#39;t know if there was some sort of misunderstanding? Maybe he didn&amp;#39;t mean to provide horrible service? He should know now since I wrote it on the receipt. I understand The Americana can have demanding cliente in general but my sister and I were in no way &amp;#34;demanding&amp;#34;. We just wanted to eat.

The wheat bread (brown) is to die for and I usually request that we get a basket of all wheat bread because I don&amp;#39;t like wasting food and the white bread rarely gets eaten. That is how good the brown wheat bread is. <br&gt;<br&gt;My favorite appetizers are the Ahi Carpaccio (Thin Slices of Raw Ahi Tuna, Wasabi Pesto, Creamy Avocado and Togarashi Aioli), and Crispy Crab Wontons (Crabmeat Blended with Cream Cheese, Green Onion, Water Chestnuts, and Sweet Chili Sauce Fried Crisp in Wonton Wrappers). The Ahi Carpaccio I can eat sometimes as my lunch entree if I am not that hungry because I always eat a lot of bread and butter at the beginning *guilty* It is soooo good. I usually ask for light wasabi pesto. The Togarashi Aoili on the side is beyond delicious. You just want to drink it. The Crispy Crab Wontons are so good and so fattening but I don&amp;#39;t care. I would literally eat them all if someone else wasn&amp;#39;t picking at the plate. <br&gt;<br&gt;My favorite entrees are: Chicken Madeira (Saut\u00e9ed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese, Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes), Miso Salmon (Fresh Miso Marinated Salmon Served with Snow Peas, White Rice (make it brown rice!!) and Miso Sauce), and the Chicken Di Pana (Lightly Breaded Sauteed Chicken Breast Served over a White Wine Butter Sauce with Mashed Potatoes and Broccoli). <br&gt;<br&gt;The only plate I tried and didn&amp;#39;t like was the Thai Lettuce Wraps (Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three (3) Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew).

The decor inside and outside of the restaurant is also quite stunning. But if I known what we were in store for, I never would have eaten here! The place was Jam Packed! The line for a table was about 20 people long, with masses of people filing up the lobby area waiting for their tables. They ran out of pagers, so we couldn&amp;#39;t go do something else during our 20 minute wait for a table, and there was nowhere to sit while we waited. The person who was calling out names for tables was doing so in a very quiet voice, and nobody could not hear him. He was very polite and was clearly trying, but I think the manager should be training people in those positions on effective ways to get the attention of the waiting guests. When finally seated, at first the waiter was attentive and pleasant. Water and bread arrived quickly. But only one of us had a place setting, and it took 10 minutes to get the attention of our waiter to get another (and the other waiters were not making eye contact with any other diners but their own). The bread was delicious, but sadly for me, it would be the only good thing I ate that night.<br&gt;<br&gt;That brings me to the nightmare that followed:<br&gt;<br&gt;We had PayPal credit available, which we were hoping to use for dinner, and CF has an app for paying that will link to Paypal. I called ahead to make sure we could use the Cake App for payment, and was told yes. But here&amp;#39;s the problem that the person on the phone failed to inform us about: to USE their app, you need a solid signal on your phone OR to connect to WiFi, BOTH of which are NOT POSSIBLE in this location!<br&gt;<br&gt;Not only do they not provide Wifi for guests, the cell signal is non-existent not only INSIDE the restaurant, but anywhere in the huge outdoor mall courtyard surrounding it (which several employees told me was a well known issue at this location.<br&gt;<br&gt;While waiting for our food order to be taken, I attempted to get the app set up and linked to my PayPal. But with no signal or Wifi, after placing my food order, I went outside to set up the app, hoping the signal would be better. No such luck! I had to walk 10 MINUTES outside the perimeter of the mall to get the app to connect! And then it took me about 10 more minutes to get it set up because it was SO SLOW. Not my idea of a date when you spend much of it alone on the street outside trying to get the restaurant&amp;#39;s app to load.<br&gt;<br&gt;When I got back to my table, I had been gone so long, that my food was there and had been sitting so long, it was all COLD. CF food is rather disgusting once it has gotten cold. So I got a few bites down and was rather grossed out. I had to leave the restaurant another TWO TIMES to get a code for using the app to pay, and to close out the bill! And we were completely abandoned by our server who went on a break, didn&amp;#39;t bother to take our dessert order after giving us menu&amp;#39;s again, and never told us he was leaving or that it was up to us to close out the bill on the app. So we sat a while before someone came over to tell us we were done and could leave.<br&gt;<br&gt;There is a LOT more to say about our experience that CF corporate and managers NEED to see, but my review exceeded the Yelp word limit, and I&amp;#39;ve already wasted enough time on CF Factory.<br&gt;<br&gt;So, in short: No Wifi, No Cell Signal. App Won&amp;#39;t work. Spent 52 MINUTES of my hour long &amp;#34;dining experience&amp;#34; walking 10+ minutes away from the restaurant to get a cell signal. Waste of money, waste of a night.

We politely told the hostess that we had a party of eight people and the woman told us that they sent people home so their sections were smaller due to the lack of waiters available so it would take a longer time for us to be seated. The other hostess was a man and made some bickering comments with the woman as we awaited a resolution to the problem. We asked if there was anything they could do so we could dine, so they told us they could put us in two booths. <br&gt;We walk over to the booths and one was actually big enough to seat all of us, however, it would have been more comfortable if we were able to just put one extra chair at the end, however, they would not allow it. At that point we all just squeezed in the one big booth to make it work. Then, they came to tell us they had another booth we could all sit in with a chair on the end, so we move happily and gratefully. <br&gt;As we sit at the new table at 10:00 pm, we order our drinks with our waitress and the original male hostess has the audacity to come by and tell us, &amp;#34;You told me you guys were just getting cheesecake,&amp;#34; and rolled his eyes and huffed/puffed away. First of all, we never said we were only getting dessert and it was so rude of him to interrupt us just to make that rude comment when we were genuinely just trying to have a good dinner all together. <br&gt;Next, even though we had a very sweet waitress our drinks and food didn&amp;#39;t come out until 10:50 pm. The waitress apologized, but it was getting ridiculous at this point due to the fact we were paying customers in their establishment BEFORE closing. There was no excuse for this, so we call the manager over to express our frustrations and disappointment, but unfortunately he was even less of a help.

Then bread and butter and/or oil and balsamic on request, and dammit if that bread isn&amp;#39;t addicting. Tall glasses of any beverage that make bringing Europeans here a real treat. <br&gt;<br&gt;Cheesecake pioneered gluttony in the 1980&amp;#39;s (as far as I knew, but &amp;#39;78 upon looking it up) when they began as a sandwich shop in Bev&amp;#39;s Hills. Big sandwich&amp;#39;s, then big portions became all the rage. And it was good. I&amp;#39;m here to report it still is today. <br&gt;<br&gt;Speaking of the bread, it was about a year or two ago I noticed they changed the yeast they were using to produce the sourdoughs, which made a HUGE difference in the structure and flavor of the bread. How the hell they implement that across 180 or so locations is probably a news segment worthy of producing, and an surprisingly interesting one to watch. <br&gt;<br&gt;When we think of chain restaurants, the title is not one of glamour. So how is a chain restaurant defined? 5 restaurants? 10? It&amp;#39;s technically 2 or more, with a unified architecture regarding both the type of food, and sometimes the construction of the building. Cheesecake therefor qualifies. But that does not make it bad. <br&gt;<br&gt;In fact, the chicken parm sandwich was served on this new sourdough, with their perfect tenderized and fried chicken (yet why the fried chicken salad was taken away I&amp;#39;ll never know), and very tomato-y marinara, making it a great sandwich.<br&gt;<br&gt;Sitting at the bar allowed for an insight into the bartender&amp;#39;s life in a 300+ seat restaurant pouring enormous drinks. Busy. Yet still the service was exemplary. Yes. That stupid word. Mostly because &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; sounds like when someone describes someone as &amp;#34;neat&amp;#34;, but when they mean it in a good way.<br&gt;<br&gt;The guac was solid too. Really. Chicken wings, just right. Not reinvented, but done well. People are surprised when I say this. Why do people have to hate? Because of the butter thing?<br&gt;<br&gt;Sure, they put butter in everything. And when it can&amp;#39;t be butter, it is another fat the vegans and vegetarians can all agree on. But so what? Isn&amp;#39;t this what those diners that we all love to love because we find something charming in their dinginess offer the world? Okay, I lost some of you there, but that is fine. Those left standing probably agree: It&amp;#39;s a Jersey diner on a national level. And it&amp;#39;s good.<br&gt;<br&gt;Just bring back the fried chicken salad. I realize it&amp;#39;s not a healthy salad. That&amp;#39;s not why I go to a place named after the most fattening form of dessert ever invented - sugary cream with a buttered graham cracker crust.

There are plenty of tables and booths inside and a decent bar with several TVs to catch a game.<br&gt;<br&gt;We each started with refillable lemonade (raspberry and regular [approx. $4.50 ea.]) and water. Then, we moved onto the avocado egg rolls ($9.95), she the smokehouse BBQ burger w/fries ($11.50), and me the wild mushroom burger w/substitute sweet potato fries ($12.50). Complimentary bread is also served. Disappointingly, we didn&amp;#39;t leave enough room for dessert and their scrumptious cheesecake, which is truly a sin.<br&gt;<br&gt;I usually like their lemonade, but this time it was a tad too sweet. I still contend that the best lemonade can be found at Red Robin. The avocado egg rolls (6 halves) are one of my favorite appetizers here and have never done me wrong. In addition, their burgers are also my favorite and one of the main reasons (along with the cheesecakes) why I dine here. The burgers are a good size and the side order of fries are plentiful. Needless to say, the portions are decent, thus, we just couldn&amp;#39;t order dessert. <br&gt;<br&gt;The service was shockingly good. I say this because historically I&amp;#39;ve had pretty shoddy service at each location I&amp;#39;ve dined at (e.g. Glendale, Beverly Hills, Pasadena, Sherman Oaks, The Grove, Woodland Hills). The hostess greeted us and immediate sat us down. And, our waiter (Daniel) was armed-and-ready to take our order. Our drink glasses were constantly filled, which is huge for me. A shutout to The Cheesecake Factory - please do whatever you can to maintain this type of service! <br&gt;<br&gt;Parking is ample as there is an expansive parking garage (1 1/2 free parking then nominal fee after). Or, you can park at The Exchange (1 1/2 free parking then nominal fee after) a couple blocks away. Or better yet, park at the nearby Glendale Galleria across the street for free! Remember, I advocate walking whenever possible.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of chain restaurants, and honestly, there are only a handful of chains I truly like. The Cheesecake Factory offers a borderline experience for me. Although they have an extensive menu and I&amp;#39;ve tried items from all category selections, it really is about the cheesecakes. As much as I enjoy their burgers, I believe Red Robin&amp;#39;s burgers are comparable if not better, at a better price and bottomless seasoned fries. Based on the prices quoted above (approx. $46.00 before tip), I feel the lack of value is prevalent. The atmosphere is casual, but please dress appropriately depending on the time of day you dine.

Now I see why they have 3 stars. I am a long time customer and honestly after todays experience I am officially taking Cheesecake Factory off my list permanently. We ordered dinner for take out like we have numerous times. Where do I begin with the problems. The chipotle pastas were the lunch portion definitely not dinner size. The Mexican tortilla salad which is supposed to have chicken had NO chicken! The beans were still frozen at the bottom and the tortilla was already shattered on the bottom. The chicken tenders were cold and soggy and soggy because the bright person who put the ranch sauce inside the tenders box didn&amp;#39;t close it and it spilled all over the chicken. The infamous bread everyone loves was cold which is hard to understand since we all assumed is baked fresh. Hmmmm. And they didn&amp;#39;t provide anyyyyyy butter to go with the cold bread. This is unacceptable and I will not tolerate it. When we called to speak to the manager the first manager put us on hold and I guess was speechless so left us on hold for another manager to handle it. So we had to explain ourselves again. The second manager instead of being professional kept asking us to dig into the trash to find a receipt that was never given to us instead of simply checking his computer for the order. This manager showed no customer service skills and in his own words explained he doesn&amp;#39;t believe us but will refund us for the salad and the tenders only and we must show up for the refund now. Does he think it&amp;#39;s a pleasant trip to make 2 times in 30 mins at americana? I guess this lack of professionalism in the kitchen must come from the managers training makes sense to me. With this experience our dinner was ruined since it went in the trash and our usual spot in americana is no more.

Knowing the risks associated by sitting at the bar (low, minimum face to face interaction) we were ready to just order and eat. I myself ordered a Kobe burger and my boyfriend ordered chicken tikka masala, along with two pineapple Moscow mules. There was another couple next to us, also at the bar, who arrived AFTER us and got their bread basket arrived BEFORE us. That was the first red flag- starving as we were, we were quick to notice this discrepancy. \u00a0Brushing it off and attributing it to being &amp;#34;rush hour&amp;#34; for serving/dinner time, we disregarded this. <br&gt;What really pushed our buttons was not being asked how our meal was AT ALL, NOT ONCE after receiving it. We are both servers, so we understand how it gets when it&amp;#39;s busy, but when you ask the couple next to us who arrived AFTER US how their food is, we take it personally.<br&gt;We usually tip 30% and LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but will probably NOT be back after this experience.

By doing so you have the opportunity to expand your culinary palate. We ordered the grilled salmon with vegetables and it was delicious. The carrots, offered on my plate, where huge and cooked to perfection; so moist and soft. The asparagus was also cooked perfectly and my favorite part was the absence of fatty oil. \u00a0We also ordered steak medallions (also on the skinny menu) and substituted the mash potatoes for more veggies.

Grateful she did this, however she has no control on what goes on at the front desk. She went on to let her manager know. <br&gt;Within a few minutes the Manager Bentley came over and sat next to me asking me to describe the incident. So I did just that; her facial expressions changed as I described what happened going from empathetic to &amp;#34;Oh I know exactly who you are talking about, man in a white collared shirt low haircut. Yes, he did tell me he was going to come over here and tell you guys to leave as he also has a big party and is desperate to be seated we laughed about it ,but I am not going to seat him here anyway I am going to seat him there&amp;#34; as she pointed to the tables behind us. I was not sure if I had understood correctly so I asked her directly, &amp;#34;You knew this aggravated man was going to come to our table, and you didn&amp;#39;t let him know that was unacceptable?&amp;#34; to which she replied without hesitation &amp;#34;Yes but it could have been a joke&amp;#34; to which I responded with a simple &amp;#34;Thank you&amp;#34; She continued with apologies but again I said &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34;. I was in utter disbelief that she knew beforehand and took it so lightly. Nikki L came by again bringing the copies of the receipts. She asked if the manager had come by and I said yes, went on to let her know Bentley already knew so it only made me feel worse. She was so upset on the manager&amp;#39;s reaction to the event she insisted on letting the general manager know. Rick stopped by gave his apologies for the 2 incidents and assured me this is not a reflection on The Cheesecake Factory.<br&gt; We are ready to go and move on with our day, as we are walking out the man in the white shirt is at the door and immediately begins to yell out offensive words and approaches the only male adult in our group calling him out to engage in a physical altercation. This causes havoc. Thankfully we were able to walk out without being physically hurt. <br&gt;As I reflect on this I think perhaps if the Bentley would have taken a more serious approach and had not made a joke out of letting an aggravated impatient man approach our table.

Though I believe that one worker should not determine the rating of an entire restaurant, let this be a wake up call to whoever decides to read my experience.<br&gt;<br&gt;So to give a little detail on the situation:<br&gt;<br&gt;I call in to place a take-out order for my little sister who works inside of the Americana, who at the time happened to be getting off from her night shift at 10:30. She was extremely hungry so I wanted to set up an order for when she got out to walk over and pick up. When calling in I spoke with a guy named Andre who kindly transferred me to the Bakery so I can place my take out order. \u00a0After waiting almost 5 minutes on hold, this guy Kevin picks up and right off the bat is rushing me to place my order. I tell him what I want and without giving me a chance to speak another word he goes ahead and puts my order into the kitchen. And this is before I could mention that I wanted it set for 10:30 pick-up. Following this just before he is about to hang up the phone I barely slip in my directions for the order , only then he claims that its late and that it will be ready in 10-15 minutes. Long story short, after an argument over the simple fact that I want the food to be prepared at 10:30 so it is not cold he rudely argues back saying it was my fault that I did not mention it before, and that he was going to see what he could do. I told him go ahead do what u can and hung up feeling disgusted with the service I just received. So I had to call back in and get a manager on the phone and sure enough he is the one to answer. When I realize this , I ask to be transferred to a manager, and he claims to be it. So I straight up let him know that is no way to treat a customer before I cut the conversation short and got off the phone.<br&gt;<br&gt;To wrap things up without going in more detail, I am writing this review in disgust of the fact that someone like that answers the phone for take out orders. I feel sorry for the company if more situations like this happen to others when calling in to place an order.<br&gt;<br&gt;Anyhow I will leave it at that .

They said sorry we do not take reservations for big parties as well. I was totally OK with that every business has they&amp;#39;re policies and we did not mind. They did say though we will seat you when you come in within 15-20 minutes, perfect right?

They said to him &amp;#34;well you should&amp;#39;ve called for a big group to make a reservation.&amp;#34; He informed them we called and I did and specifically because we were a big group so they told him well it&amp;#39;s an hour and 45 minute wait! The place was empty on a Monday that&amp;#39;s unheard of your food is not at all close to wait for 20 minutes! So I walked in and asked them for someone to help us because I called and asked in the morning and you guys said you don&amp;#39;t take reservations they said you are correct and then I asked why you guys just tell my cousin you do? She&amp;#39;s like with a smirk trying to talk back to me &amp;#34;well you&amp;#39;re wrong I didn&amp;#39;t say that&amp;#34; I literally walked in 30 seconds after my cousins walked out! We walked away and they called 3 minutes later saying your table is ready so we&amp;#39;re like ok we went back and ordered the staff were really helpful and friendly but the food was absolutely horrible 13 of the 14 people did not eat we left our plates full of food, and not to mention they forgot two entrees!

When looking through the menu, I had trouble deciding which meal to get. After scanning through it for a while, though, I stumbled upon the chicken Alfredo.

That being said, yesterday&amp;#39;s experience from top to bottom sucked. Big time. <br&gt;<br&gt;The only positive was being warmly greeted by the hostess Maddy. \u00a0As a huge Laker fan, I recognized her right away as one of the Laker Girls. : )<br&gt;<br&gt;Being that it was a gorgeous day, we asked for a table outside on the patio. Wish granted. \u00a0However, the girl who took the four of us to our table, brought us to a party of 10 people and started to put our menus down, which created an awkward moment where we were wondering &amp;#34;who are these people and why do we have to sit with them?&amp;#34; while said people were looking at us thinking, &amp;#34;who are these girls crashing our party?&amp;#34; So I told the girl, &amp;#34;Hold on, you know we&amp;#39;re not with those people right?&amp;#34; Clearly flustered, she just sat us at the closest table, dropped the menus and bolted. Well, the table was as close as any table could possibly be to the huge party, &amp;amp; we just wanted a nice, quiet lunch away from parties &amp;amp; kids, so we asked to be moved. Little did we know, we were moving to a new area that would bring us to the worst service imaginable. <br&gt;<br&gt;1.) Drinks came &amp;amp; I had some foreign object floating in my iced tea. No harm, no foul as it was replaced.<br&gt;2.) My friend decided she wanted a lemonade, so she ordered one at the time our initial drinks were being delivered (more on that later).<br&gt;3.) Normally, we request a basket of that delicious honey wheat bread (no white bread) but a mixed basket was plunked down before we had a chance to ask. No worries, less carbs is probably a good thing.<br&gt;4.) We order two Skinnyliscious Factory Salads, a Skinnyliscious Chicken Salad sandwich and a Grilled Chicken Sandwich. \u00a0After what seemed like an eternity, our food shows up. But, not all the food, only the TWO salads. One of the salads had a hair in it, but my friend wasn&amp;#39;t sure if it was hers (her hair was in a ponytail) or not. She convinced herself it was hers (EEK). Surely, the other two dishes are right behind it, right? \u00a0Wrong. \u00a0It was about 10-15 minutes before the Grilled Chicken sandwich showed up, leaving one person at our table with no food. And not wanting to be rude, we all just sat there &amp;amp; waited &amp;amp; waited &amp;amp; waited for the Chicken Salad sandwich to show up. \u00a0It was around this time, that my friend&amp;#39;s lemonade showed up (30 minutes later!) \u00a0Our waitress never came by during this entire debacle until my laser beam glare caught her from across the patio and I motioned her over. \u00a0When informed that we were missing a dish &amp;amp; that we had been waiting a really long time for it, she went to check it out &amp;amp; came back with just the side salad in a small bowl and plunked it down. Honestly, it looked like mixed greens and dressing that would have taken 15 seconds to make. Well, finally, we can all get started eating... but by that time we were pretty much fed up. \u00a0We flagged down some random girl &amp;amp; asked for the manager. Clearly, she goes and tells our server of our request for a manager instead of sending him directly over because after 10-15 more minutes the joke of a sandwich shows up, delivered by our waitress. Huge white plate, with a mid-sized sandwich sitting in the middle--not even a garnish. No joke, it was two slices of toasted white bread with premade chicken salad, lettuce and a tomato. THAT IS WHAT WE WAITED 40+ MINUTES FOR??!!! \u00a0I&amp;#39;ve made sandwiches at home that looked better than that! \u00a0And mind you, it wasn&amp;#39;t even crowded in the restaurant. Instead of apologizing, she asks &amp;#34;Do you still want to speak to the manager?&amp;#34; \u00a0Are you crazy lady? Of course we do! Even more so now.<br&gt;5.) The &amp;#34;Manager&amp;#34; - Oh boy. I think his name was Julian or Justin and I&amp;#39;m still not convinced that he was even a manager given his demeanor dealing with us. It was evident that our waitress had given him her (very skewed) version of events prior to his arrival because he comes over and very nonchalantly says, &amp;#34;So, I hear there was a dish that took a little longer to arrive.&amp;#34; \u00a0Really, dude? \u00a0Honestly, I think he apologized but I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure as he spoke very fast and mumbly, which came off as totally insincere. He offered to give us a complimentary dessert, which we declined being that 3 of the 4 of us ordered from the SKINNYliscious menu (Hellooo, summer is upon us!). \u00a0I think that threw him for a loop and he looked unsure what to do at that point. Finally, he offered to comp the meal that took ages to arrive and he left. In summary, a nice quick bite to eat for lunch turned into an irritating, unsatisfying nearly 2 hour experience.

She will walk around your table like a dozen times and each time that you try to get her attention, she gives you that lil motion about oh i&amp;#39;ll be back. Never mind her. Avoid that one. She isn&amp;#39;t of any help. She&amp;#39;s the reason that I give my review 4 and not 5 stars. <br&gt;<br&gt;I like their vietnamese tacos. They are bomb, with the pork belly and sauce on top. SOOOO damn good. The buffalo blasts are HUGE. So, if you are looking for something to share, that would be perfect. The potstickers aren&amp;#39;t bad in their tamarind sauce but there aren&amp;#39;t that many of &amp;#39;em in there. I think there were 5 in the order that was $5. I could get a whole bag of &amp;#39;em for $4 at trader joe&amp;#39;s. But, if that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re craving then go for it.

Open seating is first come first served in the bar area but nothing was open. They were out of pagers so we were given a paper ticket to come back at a certain time. <br&gt;<br&gt;We walked around the Americana for about thirty minutes and then wandered back to take another look at the bar area to see if anything had opened up in there. There were two stools at the very end of the bar top with a flat panel tv overhead and a good amount of space there, not crammed together. I have no clue why they were empty and why there was nobody else standing there waiting to snag anything that opened up. Lucky for us that we were only two and were glad to sit there. <br&gt;<br&gt;When I went to take our name off of the list it was total chaos around the host/hostess stand -with the people with tickets trying to get to the stand to claim their arrival time right next to the people just arriving and trying to put their name on the list. I heard them saying to those just arriving that the wait was an hour and a half. <br&gt;<br&gt;For our experience this time, it would&amp;#39;ve been worth an hour and a half wait. Katherine was the bartender who greeted us and laid out two clean white napkins like a tablecloth on the bar top when she found out we were going to be eating there with them. She and the other bartender were so welcoming and super nice to us even though they were slammed and taking care of drink orders for (I guess) the whole restaurant as well as for people in the bar - and punching in the food and making drinks and getting refills for those of us eating. The food runner guy was also really nice. Even though they were so busy, all of them seemed to really care about making it as good of an experience as possible for us and the rest of the customers - and I think most of us at the bar that afternoon were eating food, not just getting snacks or drinks. <br&gt;<br&gt;To add to a really great experience, the food we ordered came out absolutely perfect - especially/even the burger - which can be hit or miss almost anywhere when you request it to be grilled medium and especially if the kitchen is jamming. The bread and butter basket was given to us just as if we had been at a table or booth. Factory Burger on wheat loaf with swiss cheese, sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo on the side, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - then we had two complimentary slices of cheesecake from gift cards so we got a slice of Godiva chocolate cheesecake and a slice of key lime cheesecake and took some of it home. <br&gt;<br&gt;We live about thirty miles from here- this is the closest Cheesecake Factory to us - for whatever it&amp;#39;s worth, we will totally come back here and try to get a spot at the bar top again !", "rating": 5, "date": "1/5/2016"}, {"text": "One of 100 places alike.

It displayed with a massive amount of rice (brown) in the center than surrounded with fried chicken and like 5pcs of shrimp topped with toasted coconut flakes.

Herb Crusted Salmon &amp;amp; Shrimp, for a $20 meal I would find this as a disappointment. For that price you can get more for your buck elsewhere even with those options. Salmon was like 3 little pieces and well this wasn&amp;#39;t your average size shrimp they normally serve - more like a little bigger and only got 4pcs.

(??? How was I suppose to know that and why should their problem become mine?) Instead she insisted that all 20 of us show up by 3:30 or the tables will be given away.

She than comes back &amp;amp; asks us what we want to drink without introducing herself at all (which I don&amp;#39;t mind, but it&amp;#39;s polite). She leaves, brings us our drinks &amp;amp; bread &amp;amp; never came back at all. Since we were sitting outside I was freezing. They do have the heaters, but the wind was blowing the heat the opposite direction from us. We waited for our food out there for a LONG time. This whole time our waitress did not stop at our table once. Finally, our food came but was brought to us by a different waiter, even though our own waitress was still on her shift. I felt incredibly bad asking this, but asked him if it would be possible to move inside because we&amp;#39;re freezing &amp;amp; it was uncomfortable. He went to check the wait time &amp;amp; came back &amp;amp; told us it would be about 15 mins. He than tells our waitress our situation. Apparently she shrugged it off, as she still had not been at our table and we even have our food now! Right before a DIFFERENT waitress came to get us so we can move inside, our waitress comes to the table and just asks &amp;#34;are you guys ordering dessert?&amp;#34;. We said yes, &amp;amp; she just walked away inside without saying anything. Right as we were seated inside, we had a WONDERFUL waiter who got us situated &amp;amp; replaced our drinks for us. For the remaining time we were there inside this place, this guy filled up our drinks 4 times, was super attentive, bagged our food for us, brought our dessert within 5 mins of ordering it, and made sure we were just taken care of. I wish I remembered his name. We&amp;#39;re not difficult people to serve at all, but there a certain standard servers should have when it comes to their guests. I&amp;#39;m honestly glad I asked to move inside, &amp;amp; even though our service for the first half here was horrible, I would come here again because our service inside was amazing.", "rating": 3, "date": "2/15/2018"}, {"text": "Jason is an amazing waiter!!

It was literally a minute past 6:00, but the waiter was so nice to let us order from the Happy Hour menu if we decided quickly.<br&gt;<br&gt;I got a Cosmopolitan to drink while my boyfriend stuck to water (he`s not much of a drinker).

Its good, but it gets old. However, I will review it for those CF rookies out there. <br&gt;<br&gt;Lets start off with the bread:<br&gt;The white bread is good, but tough. The brown bread, pumpernickel I believe is DELICIOUS with butter if its warm. When the bread comes warm, eat the brown one first because its ONLY good warm. If you have the choice try to order ONLY brown bread in your basket. <br&gt;<br&gt;Drinks:<br&gt;Iced Tea is good here. Caramel Macchiato is nice. Apple Cider&amp;#39;s always fizzy. No complaints here. <br&gt;<br&gt;Appetizers :<br&gt;Tex Mex egg rolls are good, nothing TOO great, but a nice starter. A bit filling though, so I&amp;#39;d recommend these on a day when you are feeling like a salad or sandwich. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;My favorite thing in the whole restraunt has to be the Sweet Corn Tamales Cakes. They are sweet creamy corn patties with salsa and sour cream on top. I could eat these as a meal, but they are good to share. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food:<br&gt;BLT Salad is very good and simple, but the salads here are huge, so consider splitting it and getting a soup or salad on the side. Or save room for desert :)<br&gt;<br&gt;White Chicken Chili is another one of my favorite, its not an average tangy chili, its more of a rich creamy style chili. It is served on top of rice and the best part is when you get the liquid from the chili and the rice together ! Mouth-gasm. So good! Very big bowl here too. If you plan to save half, always make sure you save a bit of rice to go along with it. Also it heats nicely in a skillet as opposed to the microwave. <br&gt;<br&gt;Orange Chicken is not good. Chicken is dry and the orange sauce was taken far to literally, and it tastes like orange juice was poured on top of bland fried chicken, to be basic. <br&gt;<br&gt;Pasta Bolognese is OKAY. OKAY i mean very OKAY average. The sauce is very sweet although it has meat, maybe its supposed to be like that, but for is it is highly off putting. So that was a one time order. I ordered it with truffle oil; not sure if that added or took away from the dish.<br&gt;<br&gt;Cuban Sandwich comes in second after Portos. Very good annd a good portion although im not too \u00a0fond of the fries there. Mostly I just eat the sandwich. Very buttery &amp;amp; crispy.<br&gt;<br&gt;Cheesecakes are good.

I have to say, the spinach and artichoke dip is pretty decent, though. The rest of the food was fine but nothing specially. It looks more like a decoration than something to eat. <br&gt;<br&gt;One friend had some kind of &amp;#34;Asian&amp;#34; salad (I&amp;#39;m betting they don&amp;#39;t have a salad this large or with this concoction of items anywhere in Asia) and it had a ridiculous amount of these noodles that were really cool looking- white, long twisty/wispy noodles. They have a simple almost non-descript flavor and it must make up 30% of this salad. <br&gt;<br&gt;You get some bites from the salad that contain only this strange textured noodle. It&amp;#39;s just too overwhelming. While it&amp;#39;s a cool decoration item, it isn&amp;#39;t good as the main part of the salad. I guess we all know that CF is more about the pomp and circumstance and less about high quality food. Chicken tenders were pretty good (but let&amp;#39;s be real- they&amp;#39;re chicken tenders). The mashed potatoes served with them was an enormous pile of flavorless blah. Maybe they&amp;#39;re boxed potatoes (I&amp;#39;m assuming most of their food comes in frozen like Olive Garden, but maybe not?), but they could still flavor them.

A) they have the largest menu known to mankind. The menu is so large they have to specially bind it with spiral wiring and B) they have great cheesecake.

I took my sandwitch back and told them everything not only for my safety but for the safety of other people, who the hell knows whats in their food if not the same thing. I requested to speak to the manager. I waited and this fellow came by and I told him everything, and give him the sharps metal pieces, or atleals the ones I ddin&amp;#39;t swallow. I told him about my fear and that I didn&amp;#39;t feel good. I told him I wanted to find out how this sharp metal pieces ended up in my food. He said he would look into it and would let me know. Several weeks went by and this Public Relations lady called me never acknowleding sharp metals or telling him how they got in my sandwich, was fake and didn&amp;#39;t know what she was even calling about. Again I told her I wanted to find out how this happened so this doesn&amp;#39;t happen again. Well she said she would get back to me. Shortly after that I got a letter that didn&amp;#39;t mention the incident nor an explaination about an investigation, basically saying that we had agreed to this gift $40 dollar gift card. I never agreed to that she LIED. \u00a0I wanted to know why those shart metal pieces were in my food and was concerned about my health and of those poor souls that were or will be eating in that restaurant or any of their other restaurnats . I NEVER used there stupid gift card and never will because I WOULD NEVER EAT AT CHEESECAKE FACTORY. They don&amp;#39;t care about their customers all they tried to do cover their ASSES and pretent nothing happened. THEY THINK that people are that stupid that&amp;#39;s what they thinkg of their customers. Never ming that I could have DIED or could still have internal injuries or other people could have been in the same situation as me except they never realized it. CHEESECAKE factory you suck and your EVIL bastards. I guess they think OH who cares if a \u00a0few people DIE or suffer injuries as long as nobody knows about it.
