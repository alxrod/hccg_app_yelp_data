Although some of the food was great, most did not meet the mark. Our biggest complaint would have to be time. It took two hours from being seated to finally getting our food and only being able to eat half of it because we wanted cheesecake and could not spend the entire day there. Two hour lunch. It was ridiculous. The wait for every little thing was just soooooooo loooooong. I cannot stress how long we had to wait for everything. Our drinks went all the way down and sat empty for 20 min+ before getting refilled. It was like that between every time our server checked on us. It took forever to even get cheesecake. It&amp;#39;s already plated in a fridge, idk why it took so long. Then they mixed up our checks and it took another 20 min to get that sorted. Yeah I&amp;#39;ll probably come here if I want cheesecake but definitely don&amp;#39;t need to waste so much time of my life on dining in here.

Besides me...). And then he asked if it would be okay for me to go ahead and pay the $19.45. lolwut? <br&gt;<br&gt;There were a number of options on how to deal with the price change(s):<br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(a) Take the low-effort Asian restaurant route, and cover the old price with a sticker.<br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b) Eat the cost of your mistake, and fix the price when requested by the customer.<br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c) Ask the customer politely to accept your bait &amp;amp; switch.<br&gt;<br&gt;He actually chose (c) and with manager approval too, it seems.

Do you want to be &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; guy or girl?<br&gt; \u00a0The service was good even though we went during the Sunday brunch rush. \u00a0The one thing I would suggest is to ask to keep one menu as that table to browse the cheesecake flavors. \u00a0My favorites are the Key Lime, Lemon Raspberry and White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. \u00a0Don&amp;#39;t plan anything too ambitious for about 4 hours after a trip to the Cheesecake Factory- usually a nap while watching TV will help you through the food fog.", "rating": 3, "date": "12/1/2012"}, {"text": "Love love love the Cheesecake Factory. We did have quite the long wait, but considering it was Friday night at dinner time I can&amp;#39;t complain too much. Our waitress was prompt in taking drink orders, and gave us plenty of time to look over the ridiculously long menu. Seriously, it&amp;#39;s 15 pages. We ordered our food and only waited 20-30 minutes on a busy night, which is just fine for me- I filled up on some sourdough and pumpernickel bread. My boyfriend and his dad had crab cakes and loved them. Really, they raved about them for days. I had a burger which was nothing special but a good burger nonetheless. Then we all shared Tex Mex egg rolls. Man oh man, I wish I could eat those every day. I love those things!", "rating": 4, "date": "8/29/2014"}, {"text": "I love the Vietnamese Spring Rolls!

I had the grilled eggplant and roasted red pepper sandwich.Phenomenal. My son had the mac and cheese burger. Fantastic. His girlfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich and my husband had the factory burger. They both enjoyed theirs. The appetizers were yummy as well-firecracker salmon and the artichoke and spinach cheese dip. What is worth mentioning here is the manner in which we were treated. I have been here many times as it is the only Factory within a bazillion miles. It is ALWAYS crowded. This is not a problem for me. I am fully prepared to wait. However, I do not appreciate being rushed. If one is going to spend a hundred bucks for a meal, I think the option of at least wiping your mouth after the last bite should be open to you. We had barely laid our forks down before the bill was received and plates were whisked away. \u00a0I don&amp;#39;t appreciated being pressured to leave because the Factory failed to build a big enough building. Of course our waitress got our generous tip-I don&amp;#39;t like not paying- just give us a chance to take a breath before you decide it is time for us to leave.", "rating": 4, "date": "3/16/2014"}, {"text": "I don&amp;#39;t want to admit that I went here, but I stopped by last night for dinner with some friends.

I had a caramel apple cider that was like warm apple pie in a glass. I followed that up with a large house salad and split a vegetable penne.
