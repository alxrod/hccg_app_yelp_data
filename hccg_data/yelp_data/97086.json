The 10 dollar corking fee they charge is very reasonable, I thought the service was great as well. <br&gt;<br&gt;We were celebrating and I had a bottle of Mo\u00ebt still kicking around from NYs eve that didn&amp;#39;t get drank. So we figured we would bring it to the restaurant we were going to later that evening. <br&gt;<br&gt;The first dish we ordered was the tuna tartar. I thought it was a poor representation of what they had to offer. I&amp;#39;ve seen other reviews of it that are on par with my opinion...bland, small, an attempt at elegant food done poorly. The ring mold is meant for so much more in my opinion. It&amp;#39;s an easy trick that needs more, to remain elegant, than they are offering up. Maybe some black sesame seeds in the tartar, and a sprinkle of togarashi. Or wrap it in nori, pour ginger broth around it, anything to add something. <br&gt;<br&gt;The next plate we picked was the corn cakes. Those were good, and big, and tasty, and while I&amp;#39;m adding all these ands, and very well thought out. I could have ordered two of them. Flavorful and simple but refined. Pretty much perfect. <br&gt;<br&gt;The next course was the hibachi steak? I hope I&amp;#39;m not butchering the name of that dish because it was stellar. It was recommended by our server. She claimed it was her favorite and I see why. It was soft and juicy, and everything on that plate was done well. I highly recommend it and might just have to get it one more time because life is short and yolo. <br&gt;<br&gt;Last but not least, well at least last, was the cheesecake.. kind of the disappointment of the evening sorta but not all the way. I had mixed feelings I guess. <br&gt;<br&gt;So I figured I can get or make a simple cheesecake anywhere so try something cool. Caramel apple was what I decided on. The cheesecake part was great. Light and fluffy as it should be, the crust was perfect, whipped cream was awesome. The part I wasn&amp;#39;t fond of was the Apple part. When I think of a caramel apple I want a tart apple and sweet caramel to contrast. Instead this was apple that I would guess came out of a jar or pail of apple pie filling. It was mushy and tasted like cinnamon. Like the crap from the bucket in a bakery. That&amp;#39;s not caramel apple like at all. <br&gt;<br&gt;The math on those cakes works out to like 100 bucks a cake by the slice. I personally would want to make sure they make a pretty strong statement, especially since the place is named after them. <br&gt;<br&gt;Besides that it was a great night. I had a lager from hop valley that I am trying to find in stores it was so good, and I left happy.

They left the sauce out. My chicken sandwhiches didn&amp;#39;t come with the sauces. Had to ask for them. And then realized they also didn&amp;#39;t give us tomatoes. So I had to ask for that as well. Also when we first got there they seated us in the regular area and I asked for a happy hour menu and they said we would have to move to order from that menu. Unsure why they didn&amp;#39;t ask if we wanted to sit in the bar. Literally the whole thing was a hot mess. The server was great. She offered for the manager to come by. Talked to her.

(Totally fine, we have no problem waiting for decent food and good service) <br&gt;<br&gt;We were eventually seated and our waitress Katlyn kindly greeted us and explained it may take longer than usual to get our food due to being so busy. My boyfriend ordered the herb crusted salmon and I ordered a BLT sandwich. <br&gt;<br&gt;After waiting about 45 minutes to receive our food, it was HORRIBLE. My fries were cold and had become soggy by the time they reached our table. The bread on my sandwich was so stale I felt like I was going to damage my teeth while eating it. My boyfriend (who had never been to any cheesecake factory before) Salmon was dowsed in lemon and was so potent he couldn&amp;#39;t even eat it. Our waitress asked us how our food was and we explained the quality issues. She kindly apologized and asked if we wanted something else instead. We have NEVER sent food back prior to this and it was extremely disheartening. <br&gt;<br&gt;At that point we asked for the check so we could go somewhere else to eat since it was 9:30 pm by then. The manager ended up coming to our table and asked about the issues with the food. My boyfriend explained to him how the salmon was too strong and acidic and the manager looks at him and word for word says, &amp;#34;Well then you&amp;#39;ve never had good salmon before&amp;#34; I was horrified. We have dined at some of Portlands most upscale restaurants where he only orders Salmon. Now mind you this is a chain restaurant so our expectations were not nearly as high. After arguing with us about how wonderful he thought the food was, I told him we would pay for it all and we needed the check immediately. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our waitress Caitlyn brought our check and only charged us for the beer my boyfriend had at dinner. We tipped her $30 on the bill, because in NO way was any of this her fault. So thank you again Caitlyn for the wonderful service and I hope the manager doesn&amp;#39;t treat his staff as poorly as he treats his customers. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Washington Square location is so much better and I have never had a bad experience there.

So as for the food I seriously love their food! And the menu selection is a 10! <br&gt;but my reason for the minus one star is a incident that happened I believe several times now if this happened one time that would be OK but it happened twice and I did contact the manager about it and if things change on my next trip I will update this to 5 stars and I think that is what yelp is meant for! For us to do the social media thing and for the owners to see the negative reviews \u00a0written about their business and to actually reply if they can but at least the next time when you do go in cuz the food is good or the many other services went great, you should go back again but mention that you had a bad experience last time and that you let social media know but willing to change the negative to positive with a \u00a0hopefully blessings things changed. <br&gt;you can always go back and change your review but really come on I mean if you think about all the negative compared to all the positive it&amp;#39;s sad because people only read and base their will to<br&gt;Visit or not based on the negatives! <br&gt;you can have a business that has 1000 customers and only three customers who write a negative and bring that business down to a one star business even though it&amp;#39;s a great business because the 997 other happy customers are still going! <br&gt;But my docking of one star is due to their curb side service! I call in my order which is such confusion at times, and twice now they don&amp;#39;t come out forever! Then you gotta call again to remind them your there! Also several times I open the bag and there are no utensils or the condiments you asked for! <br&gt;One time my order was mixed up and the request I made not done. \u00a0So I called and asked for the manager, he was so nice and apologetic and even offered a free gift card but I said no need. So he said he will work on making sure orders do not get forgotten to come out and that all request are now more closely looked at and the silverware is always in the bags. <br&gt;<br&gt;Next time I go I shall surely see if there is change and if so then I would love to give them a five star! <br&gt;But I am glad that they finally came to the Clackamas side!

Their wait estimate was close -about 40 minutes in, our buzzer went off and we were seated in a two person booth. (Note: the booth was small and there&amp;#39;s no coat hooks). The overall feel of the restaurant felt small to me, verging on uncomfortable. Prepare yourself to yell-speak. You&amp;#39;ll walk out of there to the parking lot&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; and realize how all the noise made your ears numb. I also didn&amp;#39;t like that they let people waiting pretty much wonder through the whole front of the restaurant. It&amp;#39;s like you gotta fight to get in and fight to get out. We had two friendly servers (one was shadowing the other for training). We ordered two chicken pasta dishes- one good, the other okay. Cheesecake was yummy (we had the Godiva).

We decided to take my family out for a nice brunch and specifically chose CF because my son has an egg allergy, and I figured that they would be able to accommodate us since most places we go that are big chains have direct access to their ingredients. I trusted the server when I asked what menu items my son could eat specifically wondering about breads, pasta and pizza. I had told my son that he would be able to have some sort of toast since most breads do not have eggs in them. I was surprised when the server came back to tell me that all of the food that I inquired about had eggs in it...my son was stuck eating a side of avocado, side of potatoes and a small bowl of fruit. I decided to look more into this because it didn&amp;#39;t seem correct and to my surprise I found out that all of the items that I had specifically asked about were actually vegan (egg free). I cannot believe that the kitchen staff and my server would be so negligent and not try to accommodate me or my family.

A friend of ours is in town from California and being that none of us have been here before, we hoped for a great night out. We were wrong. We arrived here around 8pm, and two of our party members arrived separately and each put their name down. One of them got a 50 minute wait-time quote, and the other got no quote at all. We had been sitting down waiting patiently and enjoying each other&amp;#39;s company for only about 10-15 minutes when the manager came over to greet us, and told us that now, given the amount of large parties that are seated right now, it was estimated a 4 1/2 - 5 HOUR wait time. His name is Ashton. He spoke to us in a very condescending tone, and given that we were a group of 7 young adults with a baby, we very strongly feel that the estimation he gave us was EXTREMELY exaggerated. Never before have I ever received a wait time of more than an hour and a half. We are extremely disappointed in him for speaking to us the way he did. It gave us no reason to doubt that he only said that in hopes that we would leave, given that a party of 7 should not have to wait 5 HOURS at 8pm to get a table. We ALL work in customer service, and we know that there is absolutely no way that every single table sitting in that restaurant was going to stay at their table for over 4 more hours. No way.

We were told we had to speak to a manager due to our parties size... then we<br&gt;were told about a 1-2 hour wait (which is a large time slot window but we were ok waiting a bit). At 4:45 (2 1/2 hours later) we were finally seated. It went from bad to worse. Service was ok, didn&amp;#39;t seem to hurry to get us ordered or bring anything. We waited for bread, waited even longer for drinks and then apps. Our drinks were empty and all apps/bread gone LONG before our food finally arrived. We finally got out of there at 6:45 (2 HOURS after sitting down) and didn&amp;#39;t even want to eat dessert. I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go and was told a manager would have to add it to our bill because they&amp;#39;d totaled it already. Very weird. I would not recommend this location because the management/service/wait time. Also the food was smaller portioned than past cheesecake experiences.

I love their menu and their atmosphere. The location in Washington Square Mall turned me on to the place, however this location seems to be slacking. I have been three times since this location has opened and sadly each time seems to go worse than the last. I understand that this is a new location and it takes some time to get the gears in motion, however I think that the grace period for that has ended. All three times I attended, I have had friendly service. The hosts/hostesses and servers are pleasant. The food is usually decent as well, especially for being a chain restaurant. What I am not a fan of, however, is their lack of attention. The first two times, I recall waiting for the server for upwards of 10 minutes after being seated and nearly 30 minutes waiting for the bill. Most recently, I had to wait an hour for a table for two when the hostess let us know that it would be only be 30 minutes. Unfortunately, that is unacceptable.

The server, whose name I forget but whose face I will always remember, was wonderful! Clearly very experienced (with serving and with the Cheesecake Factory menu), he took his time with us, helped us figure out what we wanted, chatted in a super friendly fashion, and generally just made the lunch that much better. We both had the Bow tie pasta with chicken and roasted garlic cream sauce-Amazing! Will most definitely order that again! Got two slices of cheesecake to go- I am sure they will be great as well, but for now my tummy is full of delicious pasta. Overall, a terrific experience. Now, this is a BUSY location with mostly two and four top tables. You will not get in and out of this place fast. We were there close to the opening and it was still busy, so I imagine that during the dinner rush it will be kinda insane. If you are ordering from grub hub, pick things you would enjoy eating when cooled....cause the food isn&amp;#39;t going to get to you fast and hot. If you are there during the dinner rush, just sit back and relax. Even lunch was a good hour, and dinner I could see lasting two.
