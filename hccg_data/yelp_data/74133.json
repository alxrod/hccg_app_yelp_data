We had a party of 8 (6 adults and 2 small children 6 and under). We got our name on the list, and my mother mistakenly said we had 6 people. The hostess said it would be 15-20 minutes. We waited for over 30 minutes, and we were never seated, so I went to check with the hostess station. They acted like they didn&amp;#39;t realize we were waiting, even though we had a buzzer and our name was on the list for 6 people. i explained we had waited well over our quoted time. It was at this time I let them know we had the 2 small children as well. She then said &amp;#34;Oh, well, that changes everything. It&amp;#39;s going to be another 20-30 minutes at least.&amp;#34; I thought this was absolutely crazy. Another hostess then chimed in that they couldn&amp;#39;t just make seats appear out of nowhere, etc...basically I was getting treated really poorly by the front desk, and this immediately upset me and put me in a bad frame of mind. I went back to tell my family what was going on, and we all decided that we would just go somewhere else (Andolini&amp;#39;s in Jenks, and we had an amazing experience and customer service there) I do not believe that there was absolutely nothing they could do to work in 2 small children with a table of 6. It was their attitude and poor customer service that really snowballed the experience and left me feeling mistreated. Long story short, the front desk was horrible. They ruined what should have been a landmark birthday celebration for my sister. Honestly, the prices charged at Cheesecake Factory, I think I expect a lot better service than a Chili&amp;#39;s. As far as I&amp;#39;m concerned, i will never come back. I doubt my family will either.

My hamburger was so overcooked (3 people in party had hamburgers, all of which were well done and very dry) I asked for a slice of raw onion in hopes of making the burger edible. First my waitress suggested I already had onion on the burger and she looked puzzled upon my request. The waitress went back to the kitchen and brought out a slice of grilled onion that was covered in black pepper. I explained to the waitress that this was not a slice of raw onion, she seemed to have no clue what a raw onion was and went back to the kitchen. To my surprise, out came a cook or chef to apparently straighten me out. \u00a0He explained that I had a slice of onion, I showed him what was brought out and asked if the grilled onion was a slice of raw onion, he reluctantly agreed that in fact it was not a slice of onion. All I wanted was a whole slice of onion. I was given a couple of onion strings from a slice of onion. I gave up, my burger was now cold and not edible. Yikes, all I wanted was a slice of onion.

First of all, there is always a wait. I went on a Saturday at 5pm and still had to wait, but it was only for 10 minutes. The wait is worth it though. The huge menu can be overwhelming for some. If I came here more often I would venture out and try new things, but I usually stick to my favorites-pasta or chicken. The crispy chicken costeletta is one of my faves! Crispy chicken with a lemon butter sauce served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It&amp;#39;s a huge portion too. You can definitely take home half of it for another meal. My favorite appetizer is the chicken samosas. They have a large variety of small plates and appetizers. I plan on trying a few next time instead of one entree. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now for the cheesecake. The pumpkin cheesecake is back for the season. It is amazing! It&amp;#39;s creamy and spicy and the whipped cream on top is the perfect finish. I have to say I&amp;#39;ve never had a bad piece of cheesecake there. The white chocolate raspberry is delicious and fruity, but the Hershey&amp;#39;s Chocolate Bar is one of the best. I can&amp;#39;t eat a whole slice by myself because it is so rich, but it&amp;#39;s nice to share with someone. My husband and I usually get a slice each and share.

Lets just say they were busy.<br&gt;Our wait was just around what we were quoted and we sat down in a private booth got to business. Drinks- Strawberry lemonade that was rediculous. I had heard the lemonades were good, but this was lemonade heaven. <br&gt;She had the avacado chicken club. A mammoth sandwich packed with chicken, avacados, tomatoes, etc. I thought it lacked a little on dressing but it was good.<br&gt;I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Bow tie pasta in a southern spicy sauce with what looked liked southern style chicken fingers on top. The portion was more than I could finish. The flavor was similar to Outback&amp;#39;s Toowoomba Pasta, and the chicken complemented the sauce well.<br&gt;Dessert was the Banana Creme Cheesecake. \u00a0Cheesecake with a banana creme topping, whip cream and sliced bananas.
