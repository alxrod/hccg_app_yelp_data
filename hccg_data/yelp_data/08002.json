As I walked in I heard Jack Daniels calling my name so went straight to the bar, and ending up hanging out there for a while. Although I was having a drink alone, I was not sharing a drink called loneliness (Billy Joel reference). The atmosphere surely made me feel like I was somewhere else, and the staff all greeted me as they passed by as of I was just welcomed into their neighborhood. After finishing my drink, I parted ways and headed back to my car.

My friend and I stopped here for a late dinner after work on Sunday, and it wasn&amp;#39;t as busy as it usually is when I go. We had a wait of barely 5 minutes, and were sat in a little corner. <br&gt;<br&gt;I totally understand that servers work for tips, and sometimes it&amp;#39;s hard not to judge people based on appearance, but this is probably the first time that I&amp;#39;ve felt that what I was wearing significantly effected the quality of my service. Mistake number one, was wearing jeans and a T-shirt. I felt like we were stashed in a corner to not take away from the overall vibe of little dates and dinner gatherings that were going on around us. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our server brought us out two waters and greeted us, ran down dinner and drink specials and asked if we&amp;#39;d like to put in an appetizer or get anything else to drink. In retrospect, this was where we made mistake number two. My friend decided to just go with water, no alcohol to bump up the tab, and told him she was gong to have an appetizer as her entree. We asked for a few more minutes, as I hadn&amp;#39;t decided on a dinner yet. This was the turning point of our visit. <br&gt;<br&gt;The soda that I ordered took about 20 minutes to come out, when he then asked if we&amp;#39;d like bread while we wait. The bread took another 10-ish minutes, and the meal came almost immediately afterwards. No inquiry about a refill on any drinks, and we didn&amp;#39;t personally have his attention after the food was dropped for about another 45 minutes. However, he was gushing over the table seated immediately next to us, who appeared to be on a date. They ordered alcohol, appetizers, meals and were dressed very nicely. He stopped two or three times to have full 3-5 minute conversations with them, while totally ignoring us. No three bite check in, no refills, nothing. He was consistently present and attentive to his other tables, just not us. <br&gt;<br&gt;Maybe he thought we were a couple and didn&amp;#39;t like that? Maybe the casual, young adult in jeans and a messy bun appearance causes unintentional judgement because we look like we don&amp;#39;t tip well? Maybe our not ordering $100 worth of food made him feel as though we were a waste of time? In reality, we were saving room for the $50 in cheesecake that we wound up ordering at the take away counter, because two hours for a quick meal was too long to be there already, and if we didn&amp;#39;t ask for the check when we did, who knows when we would have seen him again. We didn&amp;#39;t drive 30 minutes to this establishment to be treated worse than a minimum wage fast food worker would have treated us. On top of everything else the bathroom was a disaster.

Because I need to pump up my reviews. Why are you reading this? Either your sitting in Cheesecake Factory and waiting for your waitress or you&amp;#39;re really interested in someone&amp;#39;s opinion who you really don&amp;#39;t care about. Either way thanks for reading!<br&gt;<br&gt;Stopped by on Saturday around 10:30pm. There was no wait. We got sat immediately. There was a big woman sitting by herself on her phone. To the left of us and a couple making out at the bar. A no name boxing match was on. I will reveal who won the fight (4 time welterweight champion vs some guy, spoiler alert someone got knocked out round 3). <br&gt;<br&gt;We got drinks. I got a smashing whiskey something. It was delicious. My wife got a blue moon. Drinks came out very quickly.<br&gt;<br&gt;We skipped appetizers and went right in for the kill. Unfortunately even with no crowd the wait time for our food was 30+ minutes. Do not go here if you are in a rush. <br&gt;<br&gt;I got the steak Diane and chicken medeina which is apparently their favorite dish as a combo. My wife got the chicken parm pizza lol. The calories weren&amp;#39;t listed because in sure listing a 3500 calorie bomb should be illegal. Mine was good. Steak was perfectly cooked and the chicken was moist. I like the cheese on top. When the mashed potatoes with the skin were to die for.<br&gt;<br&gt;The waitress never asked if we wanted a second drink. Oh well her loss!<br&gt;<br&gt;When we finished I couldn&amp;#39;t find my waitress. We waited another 20 minutes before she emerged. I asked for a check and a box for the remaining 2/3 of the chicken parm pizza (which was essentially a huge patty of chicken covered in pizza sauce with some noods on top). <br&gt;<br&gt;She asked if we wanted dessert and oh yeah we&amp;#39;re at the Cheesecake Factory! I ordered the classic with the cherry preserves with some ice cream. It came out with two dollops of whipped cream! I totally forgot! Too much cream. I&amp;#39;m lactose intolerant. I would regret this choice. <br&gt;<br&gt;Bill came out to $68. Not bad. If we didn&amp;#39;t order drinks we&amp;#39;d have been okay. At least we shared dessert! Still working off those calories. The waitress took another 10 minutes to come over after we finished dessert. She immediately got the check then walked away (should&amp;#39;ve waited the 3 seconds for me to give her my cc) 20 minutes go by and I finally see her chatting up another waiter. I literally need to waive the check bill in the air to flag her down before she realizes I&amp;#39;m ready. <br&gt;<br&gt;We leave by 12:10am. Could&amp;#39;ve been done in 30 minutes but I could never find the waitress. That is why they get a 3 star rating rather than 5. Other times they have been way quicker.<br&gt;<br&gt;The boxer won by knockout in the first 3 rounds. He essentially won before our food came out!

(very very good) , our appitzers we both went salads, my wife got the veggi salad,(this is one big salad) and myself a Boston salad..

We were nestled next to two couples on either side, which wasn&amp;#39;t too big a deal, although it&amp;#39;s always awkward to hear every word of other people&amp;#39;s conversation. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m always overwhelmed by the mish-mosh of offerings at CF (which seems to match the decidedly un-themed, lavish decor). \u00a0This time, I decided to stick to appetizers, allowing me to try a few different things. \u00a0We split the fried mac and cheese balls and the crabby bites, which were both delicious. \u00a0I then ordered veggie fries (fried avocado, zucchini, and portobellos), which were unfortunately very disappointing. \u00a0I&amp;#39;ve had awesome avocado fries before, but the breading seemed all wrong on these. \u00a0Luckily I&amp;#39;d also ordered the pear and blue cheese flatbread, which was excellent - the arugula on top had a lemon-y drizzle that I thoroughly enjoyed. <br&gt;<br&gt;Despite being stuffed, we couldn&amp;#39;t leave without cheesecake, so we ordered it to go. I don&amp;#39;t think you can go wrong here, as they&amp;#39;re all delicious, but my Adam&amp;#39;s peanut butter/caramel/brownie concoction was perfect, and actually lasted two days.

I tasted a friend&amp;#39;s French fries, and they were over salted. That&amp;#39;s annoying coming from fine dining. My sweet corn tamale cakes were too sweet and lacked a good contrast in textures - the cakes should be crisp with a crunchy exterior, but they were super mushy.

Then, it came time to wait for the meal. We waited and waited, and watched the other two couples receive their meals. They had burgers and salads too.

There were no fries on the plate, and Eric said the fries will be right out.

I was surprised that there was not even a cucumber or tomato or a shredded piece of carrot in sight. <br&gt;<br&gt;My husband and I just looked at each other stunned, and started eating. He could barely chew his char-burnt burger that was supposed to be medium well. Several minutes later a table runner brought out a small cup of cold french fries. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;My husband and I were quiet the rest of the meal, and did not see Eric again for a while.

My boyfriend ordered a special pesto tilapia which came with mashed potatoes, tomatoes, in a pesto sauce. He liked his entree. Mine was below mediocre. My entree arrived and looked like chicken, tomatoes, shrimp, with peppers, and onions on a bed of rice. There was absolutely no spice at all. If I had a stomach virus, I could have eaten this entree with no problem. It was bland, unseasoned, and just a big plate of nothingness. I asked our waitress for extra sauce. I was told it would take a few minutes. A gentleman arrived 10 minutes later with a bowl of hot liquid with more tomatoes. Great, is what I thought until I poured the alleged sauce over the jambalaya. I tasted the entree again and was met with the same disappointment. More blandness with even more tomatoes. I finally asked for a to-go container so I could take the entree home and fix it myself. I sat while my boyfriend finished his food. The waitress returned with a to-go box and never even asked if we liked our entrees. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure she didn&amp;#39;t really care to hear what we had to say.

But those asshats in the kitchen get minimum wage at least, most get more! \u00a0It&amp;#39;s WRONG!!!<br&gt;<br&gt;The waitress apologized again, took the food. \u00a0I was over it! \u00a0Tried not to take it out on her, I ordered a dinner salad. \u00a0Great &amp;#34;dinner&amp;#34; at Cheesecake Factory&amp;#34; - NOT! \u00a0Manager came back, apologized, offered to have asshats in kitchen make it a 3RD TIME. \u00a0No Thanks! \u00a0Spit comes with a 3rd dish, or a swipe on the floor before it hits the grill - I worked in restaurants... I&amp;#39;ve seen it happen! \u00a0I tried to explain this concept to the manager about retaliative kitchen staff(I didn&amp;#39;t call them asshats to him), but he replied, &amp;#34;well, I don&amp;#39;t know what kind of restaurants you worked in before, but it&amp;#39;s not our policy&amp;#34;. Yeah, NO KIDDING! \u00a0It&amp;#39;s nobodies policy! \u00a0It&amp;#39;s the asshat in the kitchen of your upscale CHAIN RESTAURANT, who thinks his mistake is my problem to choke down. \u00a0It&amp;#39;s his inflated ego, thinking he&amp;#39;s actually a &amp;#34;chef&amp;#34; who knows how to create new &amp;amp; flavorful, delicious gourmet meals...when in reality, he is a connect the dots &amp;#34;cook&amp;#34; - take meat A &amp;amp; add premade sauce B, cook for x minutes with C cooking method - dump on plate! \u00a0That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s always been good when I had it in the past! \u00a0Follow 3 or 4 steps - comes out exactly as it should! \u00a0My guess is someone didn&amp;#39;t pay attention to the &amp;#34;x minutes&amp;#34; the first time - but PURPOSELY under cooked the second time...

One year later, on our 21st anniversary, we went back. A tradition has begun! Here are my thoughts from our most recent romantic visit.<br&gt;We dumped the kids at the home of some excellent friends, and arrived at the restaurant about 2PM on a Sunday afternoon. Incidentally, though kids are welcome at the Cheesecake Factory, I think it would be hard to enjoy myself there with our 4 kids in tow. Our kids are pretty well behaved, but even still, I&amp;#39;d worry about them disturbing other restaurant guests, and that would keep me from relaxing and enjoying myself. Also, it&amp;#39;s a bit expensive to take kids there. Honestly, my kids would be just as happy at the golden arches...<br&gt;We were told our wait would be 20 minutes. Turned out to be only 8. Not bad. That&amp;#39;s just enough time to peer into the cheesecake cooler and decide what to have for dessert. (More on that later....)<br&gt;The atmosphere is loud, but that actually works to your advantage inasmuch as the noise level allows your conversation to be private. Surrounding conversations are simply part of the room noise, and that&amp;#39;s important since tables are spaced pretty close together.<br&gt;Some reviews I&amp;#39;ve read complain about the 19-page menu and the insane number of food choices. I personally love lots of choices. Heck, this is America, and freedom of choice is what we love, like one of those inalienable rights!<br&gt;I chose the Sausage and Broccolini Pasta. That was a real winner. Perfect pasta, fresh veggies, good flavor. The dinner portion was a lot of food, but I could handle it!<br&gt;My wife chose the Hibachi steak, accompanied by mash potatoes with wasabi butter and tempura asparagus. I sampled her steak, which was good. But I don&amp;#39;t get the idea of deep-fried asparagus. Whatever.<br&gt;Our server was very pleasant and did a fine job. Knowing that we loved that brown bread they serve, I think she included some extra bread in our doggy-bag. <br&gt;And then, of course, there&amp;#39;s the cheesecake. My wife went for the Tuxedo Cheesecake, which she loved, but I took a simpler approach: the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. \u00a0My wife commented, (but without a trace of criticism) that my selection seemed a bit &amp;#34;boring.&amp;#34; Maybe so. I admit to being much less adventuresome. \u00a0But for me, I needed purity of flavor at that point. And vanilla is never wrong. Remember that. I was quite satisfied.<br&gt;Based on a fantastic experience of great food and a new yearly anniversary tradition with the love of my life, The Cheesecake Factory is nothing but happiness for me.", "rating": 5, "date": "1/8/2013"}, {"text": "Hadn&amp;#39;t been here in a while and wishing id never stopped going.
