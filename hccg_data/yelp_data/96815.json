It didn&amp;#39;t satisfy my craving for alfredo at all. The pasta I ordered as a take-out lunch so I just chalked it up to &amp;#34;not ordering this again, oh well&amp;#34;. <br&gt;<br&gt;And the hot spinach and cheese dip... oh my goodness. The dip was hot, the chips fresh and crispy but again, no flavor. It just looked like steamed spinach with a sprinkle of cheese. There wasn&amp;#39;t even enough cheese or other ingredients to form a proper dipping sauce if I was being honest. I had brought this up to the waiter and he asked me what I wanted him to do about it. Then later he forgot about my drink order and I reminded him. Ended up getting my drink towards the end of the meal. He sincerely apologized at the end of dinner. It looked like he was new and still perfecting his workflow.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve dined here many times in that past. I like the decor and ambiance of the restaurant. Lighting is slightly dimmed so it feels relaxing and intimate with whoever you&amp;#39;re dining with at the table, despite the constant noise and motion going around in the restaurant. I like to look up at the art on the ceilings, there&amp;#39;s koi and flowers in some panels. The menu option is vast ranging from lunch potions, dinner, salads, sandwiches, seafood, pastas, pizzas, appetizers, local favorites, asian fusion, traditional american, etc. <br&gt;<br&gt;I always spend forever looking through the menu but usually always order the &amp;#34;Crusted Chicken Romano&amp;#34;. It&amp;#39;s this big baked piece of cheese coated chicken with spaghetti in this kinda like tomato bisque sauce. I think it tastes better with extra sauce.

The chips were fresh and none of the stale stuff you get from most restaurants, the toppings were flavorful and on point. No brown guacamole, pico was fresh and well seasoned.

My mom ordered the Chargrilled NY steak which, unfortunately, was pretty dry and tough for $22.95. Additonally, the veggies on both our plates were a little woody and undercooked. However, as they were rapidly approaching closing time, we did not want to make a fuss about it. I&amp;#39;m sure she would not order that steak again though, as there are many more options to choose from. <br&gt;<br&gt;For dessert, I ordered the Dulce de Leche cheesecake, which was a little overly sweet for my personal taste.

The place was jam-packed. We ordered the avocado egg rolls, the veggie burger (not Impossible burger) with Fries, Evelyn&amp;#39;s Favorite Pasta, and the Impossible Taco Salad. We enjoyed all of the items. The bread that comes out as the appetizer wasn&amp;#39;t as warm/fresh as I&amp;#39;d like/have had in previous visits to Cheesecake factory. The veggie burger is house-made but a bit on the mushy side. However, it&amp;#39;s tasty if you get a bite of all of the crunchy toppings (cucumbers and pickles) and the aioli in one bite. The impossible taco meat adds a good flavor to the taco salad but the salad is not served in a typical taco salad shell as one may expect. There are crispy tortilla strips to add the crunch element. My favorite dish was the Evelyn&amp;#39;s Favorite Pasta. The dish is very simple in the fact that it&amp;#39;s either an olive oil or butter sauce and mainly sauteed veggies, but the super crispy bread crumbs and parmesan bring the dish together nicely and it&amp;#39;s unique from many pasta dishes served in Italian restaurants. <br&gt;<br&gt;*Review from a life-long vegetarian*", "rating": 4, "date": "3/20/2020"}, {"text": "This was a very very busy place. I myself probably wouldn&amp;#39;t bring my children here to eat at all. It&amp;#39;s just too much going on here. <br&gt;<br&gt;We were seated within the first 5 minutes of checking in. We sat in the back area on the upper level I guess you could call it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our waiter was very laid back &amp;amp; relaxed. Maybe a little too much. But... I like when they&amp;#39;re that way. SOMETIMES. Because then I feel that I too could be a little more laid back myself. <br&gt;<br&gt;Well we had a GC of $25 &amp;amp; a couple Comp cards for Free cheesecake. Maybe I should t have said anything to him BEFORE we were served. <br&gt;<br&gt;Idk. I only say that because we were really well dressed because we just came from the symphony. So obviously we looked as if we were there to spend some scripts. But I feel that because we DID mention the GC &amp;amp; COMP CARDS TO HIM PRIOR TO ORDERING, it made him feel as if we didn&amp;#39;t have money to spend and that we were probably gonna tip him terribly. THATS JUST OUR OPINION. He didn&amp;#39;t have his name tag on, so we couldn&amp;#39;t get his name. But the reason why I said that is because we weren&amp;#39;t ready to order just yet. And he was ok with that. Finally we were ready to order, we set out menus at the end of the table &amp;amp; waited about 10 minutes before he actually looked st us again. And what I mean when I say... &amp;#34;he finally looked at us&amp;#34; was because he passed or was right across our table at least 5 times before he glanced at us. I then waved him down gesturing we were ready to order. We put in our order and it came within a reasonable time. But my husband was missing his fries, and he forgot to get me Parmesan cheese on the side. So, he came back with my cheese. Apparently the cooks forgot to make my husband&amp;#39;s fries, so that took a while. But when it finally arrived \u00a0it was very Ono. My pasta, however, wasn&amp;#39;t as great as it was @ the Kapolei Cheesecake Factory. That one there was Oh oh ONO! But this one... it tasted MORE SALTY than creamy. Now maybe it was because I had added in some extra parm cheese, but... still, it shouldn&amp;#39;t have changed the taste of the cream. If anything... the cheese should&amp;#39;ve enhanced the flavors to blend together and NOT taste so over powering. My husband on the other hand said his mushroom burger was AWESOME!!! I knew I should&amp;#39;ve gotten that instead. LOL!! But I took my pasta home. I think I only took 3 bites from it too. I didn&amp;#39;t want to make t into a BIG DEAL &amp;amp; so I just ate the molasses bread. <br&gt;<br&gt;As we waited for our waiter to finish cleaning the table across of us, another waiter approached us and asked if we were ok, removed my husband&amp;#39;s dishes &amp;amp; asked if we wanted refills &amp;amp; a container for my pasta. So THAT waiter took my plate and packed it for us, came back with a refill &amp;amp; asked if we needed anything else. HE WAS A GOOD WAITER!!<br&gt;<br&gt;Our actual waiter was like... &amp;#34;OH! I DIDNT REALIZE THEY WERE DONE. THANKS MAN!&amp;#34; (Hence why I said... &amp;#34;Maybe our waiter was too laid back &amp;amp; I shouldn&amp;#39;t have said anything about the GC &amp;amp; CC&amp;#34; prior to ordering) \u00a0After the other waiter left, our waiter asked if we&amp;#39;re ready to order \u00a0our cheesecakes. We took 2 oreos. Gave us the bill. Made out cheesecakes &amp;amp; cashed us out. We then was done, thanked our waiter, left him a tip in the folder and went on our way. <br&gt;<br&gt;Like I said... HE WASNT A BAD WAITER @ ALL. Maybe he was just tired and it was near the end of his shift. And it&amp;#39;s probably just ME being nit picky about how things went. sorry... I&amp;#39;m just being thorough, that&amp;#39;s all. <br&gt;<br&gt;NOT SAYING WE DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE VIPS or like a KING &amp;amp; QUEEN. HELL NO!! I&amp;#39;m just saying he probably was comfortable with us that&amp;#39;s all. And I&amp;#39;m ok with that too. Which is why we DID tip him 25% instead of 15% or 20%. Maybe he had a long night and by time we came in... he was ready to go home and sleep. They were super busy!! I mean am the waithelp we&amp;#39;re jamming. Even the managers too. <br&gt;<br&gt;So did I enjoy myself here?! Yeah... sure! Would I come back? Uhhh... only if we really had to. For someone else&amp;#39;s birthday or an event then yeah.

I wouldn&amp;#39;t bring kids here. <br&gt;<br&gt;Restrooms were small kine messy. Counter tops were full with left over water puddles from peoples drippings. Lighting is very very dim. I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend those with bad eyes to go there to eat. Because even the restaurant itself is dimmed. Not as much as the restrooms, but it is dimmed lighting. I think the bathrooms ONLY LOOK a lot dimmer than the restaurant itself because of its BLACK MARBLE COUNTERTOPS AND BATHROOM STALL WALLS AND DOORS. They&amp;#39;re ALL BLACK. So it makes the bathrooms seem darker than it should be. Although I likIt&amp;#39;s can be very dangerous for someone who doesn&amp;#39;t have good sight.

Lady do you not see this gang of other people also waiting for their food they just ordered?! Do you not see that there&amp;#39;s only 2 respectable human beings behind the counter working their butts off during this pandemic?! Do you want undercooked fried calamari?! Like whooooooo does she think she is?! Oh this is your second order today? Okay then you&amp;#39;ve had food already so sit down woman!! <br&gt;<br&gt;And to the employees behind the counter... sis I didn&amp;#39;t get your name... but bless your heart. You deserve a freaking medal. You didn&amp;#39;t get crazy. You suppressed your anger. A feeling I am well familiar with in this industry. But given the state of emergency this country is enduring. Like I&amp;#39;m not 100% sure I could&amp;#39;ve kept it together as well as you.

I also added some grilled chicken to my salad to boost my protein intake. <br&gt;With my salad, I ordered an ice tea to wash all of this down.<br&gt;<br&gt;My friend ended up ordering the - The Classic Burger, which was a gigantic chop house hamburger.

They have such a large selection of cheesecakes, I have to admit, it&amp;#39;s pretty hard to decide on which cheesecake to order. <br&gt;At the end, I ordered the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake - which was a Banana Cream Cheesecake topped with bavarian cream, and it came with fresh sliced banana. <br&gt;<br&gt;My friend got the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake - which was layers of creamy vanilla bean cheesecake, vanilla mousse &amp;amp; it was topped with whipped cream.<br&gt;<br&gt;What can I say about the grub?<br&gt;<br&gt;I really loved my Super Antioxidant Salad! It was the perfect meal which didn&amp;#39;t leave me bloated, or too full..........having that salad saved me some space in my tummy for dessert!

First off, this restaurant is known to be crazy busy and provides no reservations.. laaaame. Their menu is huge and sometimes overwhelming which is why I didn&amp;#39;t wanna take pictures of the menu because there was like at least 6 pages (back and front). We waited in line for about 1.5 hours. Luckily, we got seated before it started raining hard. Anyways, I ordered the grilled ribeye steak with a side order of fries which were somewhat soggy. I didn&amp;#39;t even get a steak knife to eat for almost 8 minutes since my steak was delivered to my table. My steak started getting warmish-cold so I had to actually walk into the restaurant to look for a worker because either no one was coming outside or when they did, I couldn&amp;#39;t catch their attention. On top of that, the steak was super thin and looked like a hamburger patty and it was really bland that I had to rely a lot on the A-1 steak sauce. I know steak is not what they&amp;#39;re known here for, but even Zippys crappy steak tasted better than what I had. My wife had the Jumbalaya pasta and a Blue Hawaiian alcoholic beverage, my oldest had the chicken Carbonara pasta, and my youngest got the grilled cheese sandwich. My friends had the steak Diane, some kinda baked lemon chicken, pepperoni pizza, and some kinda cheesesteak sandwich. They all thought it was ok or pretty good. For dessert, we had different sorts of cheesecake flavors. I had the Oreo flavored one which was huge, but super rich and yummy. The others had the strawberry, tiramisu, and snickers flavored cheesecakes. My friend really wanted the &amp;#34;celebration&amp;#34; cheesecake, but apparently they ran out...laaaame..lol <br&gt;<br&gt;Honestly, this will probably be the last time I ever eat here again only because I hate that they don&amp;#39;t take reservations so the wait is forever, the seating setup outside is horrible and super tight, the steak sucks, the pasta was mediocre, and this crab dip that we ordered for appetizer was ok. On top of that, it isn&amp;#39;t cheap either. I don&amp;#39;t like complaining about my food in-person because it was already pretty late and I&amp;#39;m not tryna wait any longer. Plus, not that I&amp;#39;m saying this restaurant does this, but I&amp;#39;ve seen the movie, Waiting, and I&amp;#39;m not tryna get a &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; from complaining about my food...lol<br&gt;<br&gt;The parking is located in the Royal Hawaiian parking structure. When you validate your parking ticket at the restaurant, the first hour is for free and so after, it&amp;#39;s like a $1 more every hour or so. You have to pay for your ticket before you leave the structure. There are machines right in front of the elevators so you won&amp;#39;t forget.

But, as soon as the doors opened, the friendly and cheerful hostesses quickly escorted the people to their seats, including us. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;TCF&amp;#39;s menu is filled with so many menu items that it is like reading a book and we took our time to &amp;#34;study&amp;#34; the menu. \u00a0 Our server was so patient, cheerful and attentive.

The Parmesan crusted chicken, according to Lora, was chicken breast meat that was crisp on the outside and juicy, tender inside. \u00a0The bow tie pasta was cooked al dente and the creamy &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; New Orleans sauce provided a nice complement to the crispy-crusted chicken. \u00a0As for spiciness, it wasn&amp;#39;t spicy at all and barely had a chile kick but, the flavor was good. \u00a0The lunch special was priced at $14.95 whereas the dinner portion usually runs as $18.95.<br&gt;<br&gt;-Evelyn&amp;#39;s Favorite Pasta: \u00a0Rigatoni topped with broccoli, oven-dried tomatoes, roasted eggplant, mushrooms, onions, artichokes, Kalamata olives, garlic and pine nuts. \u00a0I always seem to order this pasta because of its flavorful Mediterranean flavors. \u00a0But, I really wish they hadn&amp;#39;t removed their Indian Fry-Bread sandwich. I ordered the dinner portion as it was priced at $15.95, just a dollar more than the lunch special and got a larger portion that I could doggie bag for later snacking.<br&gt;<br&gt;-Renee&amp;#39;s Special: \u00a0Half of a turkey sandwich came with today&amp;#39;s special soup (Stuffed Baked Potato) and tossed green salad for only $12.95. \u00a0My husband enjoyed his turkey sandwich which was stuffed with fresh lettuce, tomatoes and lots of fresh baked turkey. \u00a0The stuffed baked potato soup was thick and tasted like a fully-loaded potato yet in a soup form.

Waitress took drink order and food orders and not surprisingly the food came out quicker then the waitress initially did. \u00a0After that, waitress was pretty much spot on with the service. She helped me with the take out cheesecake, the request for Parmesan cheese by my daughter was fulfilled with a block of real Parmesan which I put on my steak, my wife&amp;#39;s mashed potatoes and both my kid&amp;#39;s mac and cheese. The food was good, my steak was perfectly done, kid&amp;#39;s cheese quesadilla was delicious as I stole a piece.

I get that it was getting late and they were probably starting to shut things down but orders are still orders and people&amp;#39;s health isn&amp;#39;t something to be played around with! <br&gt;After watching the baker get half way through with the sundae, I simply ask her &amp;#34;Are there no gloves?&amp;#34; And to my surprise SHE GOT SO UPSET!! In an angry tone she asks &amp;#34;DO YOU WANT IT OR NOT?&amp;#34; I was honestly caught off guard by her reaction that I simply replied &amp;#34;I just want you to put on gloves...&amp;#34; At that point she was slamming plates obviously pissed off that she was caught doing the wrong thing...I just stood there watching and AGAIN she started to make ANOTHER Godiva Brownie Sundae for me with NO GLOVES ON. I ask her once more to put on gloves and SHE YELLS AT ME and tells me to stop watching her and she&amp;#39;s swearing that her hands are clean... I can&amp;#39;t believe how rude she was so I asked her for her name and with no hesitation she screams &amp;#34;ISABELLE KING!&amp;#34; <br&gt;I find a manager standing by the host stand not paying attention to anything that just happened and ask &amp;#34;Aren&amp;#39;t the bakers supposed to wear gloves?&amp;#34; Confused he replied, &amp;#34;well they&amp;#39;re supposed to be?&amp;#34; I couldn&amp;#39;t believe what just happened so I just went back to my table and told my friends about it. <br&gt;After about 10 minutes Stephanie, the manager of the Bakery comes to the table and asks me what happened. After telling her everything, she basically tells me and I quote &amp;#34;You shouldn&amp;#39;t be micromanaging my workers!&amp;#34; She says that because I&amp;#39;m a guest it&amp;#39;s not respectful to watch the bakers and I shouldn&amp;#39;t have asked her to put on gloves and if I had a problem, I should&amp;#39;ve just asked for a manager. Apparently as a guest you shouldn&amp;#39;t watch the bakers because it&amp;#39;s not respectful... Right?<br&gt;Wrong! I&amp;#39;m pretty sure if the Cheesecake Factory thought it was disrespectful for guests to watch the bakers make their desserts they wouldn&amp;#39;t have the bakery up front where it&amp;#39;s the first thing you see when you walk in!!! After her speech of how I was disrespectful, I never got an apology for her disrespectful worker.<br&gt;Food for thought- Be very cautious about dining in here because obviously health codes and guest services aren&amp;#39;t top priority at this location!

So, I wanted to recreate the experience in Waikiki.<br&gt;<br&gt;At 6:45pm on a Wednesday, the quoted wait time was 30 mins. It was VERY CROWDED inside and out. But, there are plenty of great stores in the vicinity to check out. Or, you can stand in line at the Cheesecake/Take-Out counter to order dessert in advance! Three words: Lemoncello Creme Torte.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our pager buzzed within 30 mins, as quoted, but that was really deceiving. We still had to wait another 15 mins once we turned in our pager. There were at least 20 other customers waiting, too. For a moment we thought they forgot about us, so we inquired with one of the hostesses. She explained, once we turn in the pager, it means that our table is being prepared [not ready!]. They will call us by name when our table is ready.<br&gt;<br&gt;So, this tall, handsome young man finally calls our party of 2. He was probably the most calm, sincere, and friendly host as we walked from the front to the back of the restaurant. As we approached our table, he asked that we stand to the side to wait a few more moments as they prepare our table. Ha! I don&amp;#39;t know if the restaurant always operates like this, but here&amp;#39;s an idea: page/buzz customers when the table is actually ready!<br&gt;<br&gt;Our server tended to us quickly, but at times was talking way too fast I could barely comprehend what he was saying. I felt like the restaurant suckered us in falsely advertising a &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; wait time and now we&amp;#39;re being rushed to order. Well, it took another 45 mins to receive our entrees - maybe that&amp;#39;s why he was talking fast. So in the meantime, we snacked on the complimentary bread, which was not as fresh as I remember. <br&gt;<br&gt;Chicken Marsala. The dinner serving was large enough to share between 2-3 people!! So, I ended up packing 3/4 of the plate for home. The bow tie pasta was cooked al dente (which I like). The chicken was tender. The combination of the Marsala sauce and mushrooms was divine. However, after eating a few bites, I was already full (darn you, bread!).<br&gt;<br&gt;We also had Fried Calamari. That was actually excellent. Definitely at the top of my list for best calamari in town!

That place is &amp;#34;The Cheesecake Factory&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;The Cheesecake Factory has been a destination for my family for years now, I used to have them take me here on my birthday. Now days though we seldom get the chance to go because of distance and parking and the nighttime craziness that is Waikiki in general, anywho lets break this down into categories again. <br&gt;<br&gt;Hostess/Front desk <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m giving this its own category in this review simply because of how much time you are likely to spend here. The wait times I&amp;#39;ve witnessed have been anywhere from 45 minutes to 3 hours depending on the time and day. If you really want to try and avoid the wait you need to come in the 3-5pm hours and even then you&amp;#39;ll likely be handed a 20-50 minute wait anyway. <br&gt;<br&gt;The people at the front desk do their best to accommodate everyone but please, please keep in mind that these people get swamped all at once by people who speak a variety of languages, there are only 3 to 5 people at that desk for hundreds of people trying to check in, check out, validate parking ect. They will be sluggish occasionally but yelling at them about it will only make their day worse and the wait longer for everyone else so PLEASE SHOW UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT while you are waiting so everyone can run through as quickly as possible. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you get to the Cheesecake Factory too late you might be faced with a line, this line will exit the restaurant and nearly hit the street, in my experience at this point your wait will likely be over an hour. <br&gt;<br&gt;They will occasionally run out of pagers too. <br&gt;<br&gt;One final thing is that due to how many people there are you can help the line a lot by only sending up one person from your party to wait in line, seriously, like you have no idea how much of a difference that will make with people trying to exit the restaurant with strollers and such. <br&gt;<br&gt;Interior and Cleanliness<br&gt;<br&gt;I tend to trust restaurants that allow you to see inside their kitchen, they aren&amp;#39;t afraid of showing you what they are doing because they know they have nothing to hide. <br&gt;<br&gt;On the inside you have a very sophisticated feeling space, it&amp;#39;s dimly lit with &amp;#34;marble&amp;#34; table tops and rich woods, very well maintained especially considering the amount of people through the space in any given hour. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service<br&gt;<br&gt;The service here is great, we only had one issue where our server very clearly and specifically asked if my father wanted his soup before or with the main courses and my father very clearly and specifically said he wanted it before hand. The server then said he would get it right away and left. <br&gt;<br&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t get it until the main courses came at which point my father sent it back because it was too much food at once, which was a shame, that soup smelled really good. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food<br&gt;<br&gt;With the amount of food delivered to our table I only tried 3 items personally and I only remember the names of 2 of them. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Bacon-bacon Burger (Pictured) : Well cooked with a very nice toasted bun, crossed with bacon and served with the lettuce and such on the side so you can choose if you want it or not. It was spot on, solid 5 star dish <br&gt;<br&gt;The everything Pizza (Not Pictured): The dough on their Pizzas is really flavorful and the fresh ingredients pop. The meats had a smokey flavoring to it that was just amazing, complemented nicely by the cheese. <br&gt;<br&gt;Crab. . .something. . .crispy Won-tons (Pictured): Yeah, this is the one that I forgot the name for, but these are great. The crab is so creamy and the sauce works well to complete the taste. <br&gt;<br&gt;All in all due to the experiences we&amp;#39;ve had over the years I will give The Cheesecake Factory 5 stars despite the issue with the soup, my reason for this is because since we&amp;#39;ve been coming here that has been the only issue we&amp;#39;ve had.", "rating": 5, "date": "7/14/2015"}, {"text": "We went tHere last week for my birthday and the food was okay \u00a0but the service was horrible.

We are residents of Waikiki and were hoping to find a new happy hour restaurant we could enjoy on a regular basis.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our young man server was very nice. However, we had to flag him to order drinks and food after waiting 20 minutes. I don&amp;#39;t think we were in his section. So we thought that was nice of him to attend to us. The drinks arrived 10 min later and the small happy hour dishes arrived 10 minutes after that. Unfortunately my order was incorrect (chicken instead of beef). 20 minutes later, my friends had finished eating and my food had not yet arrived. We called over the manager. He told us he just came on shift and didn&amp;#39;t know anything about our order. He kept asking, &amp;#34;What did you order?&amp;#34;, without letting me explain the situation. He just didn&amp;#39;t want to hear and seemed irritated. He never returned to inform me of any resolution. 20 minutes later, my food (now to go) arrived by another server. When I took it home, I discovered the onions had not been included. It&amp;#39;s the sauteed onions that make the burgers better than McDonalds. The mojito tasted sweet and minty, but I could not taste the rum. It was very weak. I called the restaurant and was refunded the $7.50 for the burgers. The woman with whom I spoke was nice and attentive. If I was the manager, I would have comped the drink as well, considering the very poor overall experience.<br&gt;<br&gt;My friends noted the spinach dip and the avocado egg rolls were quite good. The hamburgers were disappointing.<br&gt;<br&gt;In summary: nice wait staff, some food good, weak drinks, poor management, and apparently a chaotic kitchen.

We probably come every 3 months and sometimes we&amp;#39;re missing a person (usually me) but the missing person gets their order taken home to be enjoyed for second sessions. <br&gt;<br&gt;We usually come around 3 to avoid waiting for a long time and we like to sit in the 80s because of the beautiful view. We usually sit at table 85. <br&gt;<br&gt;Coming here is like lunch/dinner and lunch tomorrow! Our usual course of action is bread but we ask for no white and double brown bread, 2 orders of the tempura spicy ahi roll, and the chicken lettuce wraps. A lemon drop for my mom, a Long Island for my brother, and my dad picks something new every few visits-yesterday he got the bourbon and honey which he said was smooth and delicious! <br&gt;<br&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s talk about those apps-if you are a family of 4, you can not order one roll. You will fight over those pieces. It&amp;#39;s better for everyone to just order two and let everyone get enough pieces to be happy. After you&amp;#39;re done, the brown bread dipped into the sauce is THE BESSSSTTT! The lettuce wraps are my mom&amp;#39;s favorite, she sometimes orders them for her entree she enjoys them that much. They come with 3 sauces that are all delicious and I like to put all 3 into my lettuce wrap. <br&gt;<br&gt;Entrees:<br&gt;My dad almost always orders the jambalaya/gumbo (I&amp;#39;ve included a picture). I don&amp;#39;t remember which title it has because my food is so delicious I don&amp;#39;t pay super close attention but he always gets the same thing so it must be awesome. <br&gt;<br&gt;My mom usually gets fish tacos which I always want a bite of but never do because I&amp;#39;m so full by the time she offers. <br&gt;<br&gt;My brother and I switch around a lot. He usually gets steak and I used to order chicken. Our favorites are the chicken costoletta, the chicken Madeira, and the chicken Marsala. But seriously if you haven&amp;#39;t had chicken costoletta-you should 100% order that. <br&gt;<br&gt;I gave up being vegetarian yesterday because it was such a tease not eating chicken costoletta so I ordered the herb crusted salmon yesterday which was also delicious and served very similarly to the chicken costoletta.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our family always orders dinner sized entrees because we take home half or more and have it for second sessions around 7:30 or for lunch the next day. <br&gt;<br&gt;Dessert:<br&gt;Our normal route is to order 1 for the table so we can all have a couple bites and then one each to take home. <br&gt;<br&gt;The one for the table is usually something new or the seasonal cheesecake. My dad always orders the Godiva, my brother always orders the kahlua and I used to always order the Adams peanut butter fudge ripple but now I take after my mom and try a new one each time.

Self-serve seating! As soon as you see an empty table grab it and plop your behind down! There service is quite attentive and someone will catch your eye and drop some menus.

It&amp;#39;s loud in there. Of course mainly bc of the volume and traffic of people. But who comes to Cheesecake Factory anyway to have a &amp;#34;quiet candlelight&amp;#34; dinner.

Try not to fill up on it even though it is bottomless. 1st up. Can&amp;#39;t go wrong with there &amp;#34;Fried Mac-N-Cheese&amp;#34;! Comes in 4 tennis ball sized pieces, breaded outside toped with sauce, slice down the middle and watch the cheese ooze right out. \u00a0Yah better dip that bread all up in der.

The music was a little loud when you first walk in, so you couldn&amp;#39;t really hear the hostesses. But getting to your table the music kind of died down a little. The lighting of the restaurant was dimmed all around with the tables having their own lights shown on then. <br&gt;<br&gt;The menu...was crazy! 21 pages of over 200 different varieties of items to choose from!

I ordered the filet mignon, which is one of my favorite steaks. Normally the filet is suppose to be a lean cut of steak with no fat to it, just all meat. But the one here is the first ever filet that I&amp;#39;ve found some fat in. I mean it was good, but it could&amp;#39;ve been better without the fat. <br&gt;<br&gt;For desert, I was suggested either the banana cream cheesecake or the key lime cheesecake.

I was pretty adamant about that because when we go out to eat we usually are so stuffed from our food that we end up passing on the dessert...well not this time. I had the white chocolate raspberry truffle and my husband had the Salted caramel. Both were delicious but I thoroughly enjoyed mine better. You can not go wrong with white chocolate and raspberry in my opinion. We then ordered the Kalua pork nachos...so yummy, so yummy! After skimming through the menu, I was so undecided on what I wanted to eat because there was so much to choose from. I decided to wait, since the nacho portion size was so big. My husband ordered the Hibachi steak. And it was very flavorful. I had a few bites of my hubbys plate and opted not to order a meal because I was stuffed. Of course we ordered a cheesecake to go, we went with the dutch apple caramel streusel. My husband swears he had his cheesecake fix. But I found my cheesecake the next day half eaten by him. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, the food and cheesecake was awesome. We will definitely return, but I&amp;#39;ll make sure to request seating outside of the bar area because it was hard to hold a conversation even though we were sitting right across the table from each other.", "rating": 4, "date": "12/6/2016"}, {"text": "We had the most \u00a0amazing food and experience last night!

That&amp;#39;s probably one of the main reasons why it&amp;#39;s always so busy. If you come here for lunch, wait times are actually good. Usually if you get there before noon, you can get sat right away. But if you come here for dinner, you better eat like a side meal or bring a snack because wait times can go up to almost 2 hours! And sometimes they even run out of pagers, so they just give you a piece of paper and ask you to come back later for a pager.<br&gt;<br&gt;Cheesecake Factory has a very large and expansive menu, over 250 dishes! They have everything: lunch specials (served until 5pm), breakfast all day, burgers, regular entrees, alcohol and CHEESECAKE for dessert. I normally come here for lunch with my coworkers and we usually take advantage of their lunch specials. They have couple options on their menu that comes in lunch-size portions: salad, soup and salad, salad and pizza, pasta, chicken, salmon and other specialties for reasonable pricing. I normally get the salad and pizza (BBQ Chicken Pizza is my favorite) as I always end up taking home leftovers because the portions are large for me. My boyfriend usually appreciates when I have leftover pizza for him to eat lol. And of course you can&amp;#39;t forget about their famous cheesecakes. I normally don&amp;#39;t make it to dessert, but they have over 30 different flavors. And depending on the season, they may have special flavors to try. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;On my most recent visit, we came here for dinner around 6pm for a party of 8. The wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes. OMG. But since this is where the birthday girl wanted to go, we decided to walk around Waikiki and just wait. We luckily got buzzed 15 minutes earlier, but because our big group split up during the wait, only 3 of us were able to make it back to the restaurant first. They wouldn&amp;#39;t sit us until half our party was there. A bit ridiculous if you ask me as we were already waiting for so long. We told them they were in the area and on their way, but they still wouldn&amp;#39;t sit us. So as we waited for the rest of our party to show up, we prayed they didn&amp;#39;t give our table away. <br&gt;<br&gt;After we finally got sat, the first thing everyone asked was &amp;#34;are the lights on?&amp;#34; It was so dark, we had to use the flashlight off our phones to see the menu better. On top of that, our waiter, Brian I think was his name, was the real MVP (sarcasm). When he finally took our orders, he would take down 2 orders, then disappear, and then show up again, and then disappear again. It was quite annoying as he did that with our water refills too. And when we asked if it was possible to split the check, he tried to make us feel bad by saying it&amp;#39;ll take longer to split. And before he left to place our orders, he made another comment that he thought was funny by saying &amp;#34;I had to stop my temptations to tell you I can&amp;#39;t split the check.&amp;#34; I know I probably gave him the death stare after he said that because that was just rude! After we got our food, he was non-existent until we got our bill. The only highlight of that night was there was live entertainment that played oldies but goodies songs. <br&gt;<br&gt;Other than that rude waiter, the food here is actually not too bad. I did like the Chicken Madeira. The chicken was tender, had lots of mushrooms and asparagus and the sauce was delicious. I liked the cheese, but it may have been too much cheese on the chicken. Their Miso Salmon is another favorite of mines. As for their cheesecakes, my favorite is probably their Pineapple Upside Down cheesecake. And I recently tried their Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake. It looks really rich, but it was actually light and fluffy. And it came with a huge oreo cookie on top!<br&gt;<br&gt;Customer service isn&amp;#39;t the greatest here as on other occasions, service is usually slow, even during lunch time when it&amp;#39;s not too busy.

I shook my fist in the air and screamed &amp;#34;Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!&amp;#34; After my fit and several rounds of crying, I proceeded to order the tomato basil penne pasta and a french country salad which consisted of greens, asparagus, beets and goat cheese. I ran back to my booth and returned twenty minutes later for my order. Back at the Yelp booth the three of us (me, Thomas O &amp;amp; Pua P) dove into the two dishes. The portions in classic Cheesecake Factory style were gigantic! The pasta was nothing too adventurous but satisfying. The french country salad exceeded my expectations and was very tasty!

Call me lucky but, of all the times I&amp;#39;ve dined in, I&amp;#39;ve not had to wait for more than 20 minutes. Upon leaving your lovely name on the list with the hostess, you&amp;#39;re given your nifty restaurant pager. Cheesecake factory sits on the right side of Kalakaua&amp;#39;s busy street (next to Forever 21) on the first floor. You can&amp;#39;t miss it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Wooden furnishings and marble tiles give the vicinity a nice elegant touch with very light metalwork elements. On the right side of the entrance, people form a separate line for takeout and making ordering easy for slices of their famous cheesecakes. That is if you only want to want a pleasuring dessert on the go. The line goes fairly quick. \u00a0With an already large restaurant, Cheesecake Factory seems to have a fast turnaround with seating. \u00a0An inviting part of the restaurant is the bar with large screens for the sports fanatics. Seats line the bar as well as high top chairs as an option for dining in a more laid back scale. Their clean restrooms are readily available on the right if you break the seal too soon (if you know what I mean). Seats are available in family style and large parties. I very much enjoy their outdoor seating option as it gets freezing cold inside the restaurant. It&amp;#39;s also very dim and not enough light on the inside. Why not dine outside and appreciate the alfresco with the fresh smell of the pacific ocean.<br&gt;<br&gt;My dining companion and I wanted to dine outdoors and we were seated after 10 minutes. \u00a0A server had stated she will be with us shortly. At this time we still have not received our waters or even any service for that matter. The restaurant wasn&amp;#39;t at all busy yet. We were very forgiving and gave her another 5 minutes or so. After she returned repeatedly serving the table behind us it was already 15-20 minutes later. I upsettingly flagged the server on the opposite side asking for waters and for service. He immediately discovered my unruly tone and called for a manager. Slade (the general manager) approached us and immediately apologized for the lack of service and checked on us from time to time. Bobby (our new server) had apologized and served us wonderfully during the duration of our entire dining experience.<br&gt; <br&gt;After enjoying their nicely toasted white and wheat bread with butter, I enjoyed their Garlic Noodles. This is a nice spaghetti dish with fresh asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, nice whole oven roasted cherry tomatoes with parmesan in a garlic sauce. This is beautifully served with a nice big part of the chicken (can be ordered with shrimp or chicken). I enjoyed this dish with all the vegetables and the chicken as my protein. The chicken is delightfully juicy and not greasy and the little part of the skin was crunchy after the first slice into the meat. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I very much enjoyed my recent experience here with a slight bump on the side. Their customer service is great with them recognizing the flaw right away. I&amp;#39;ve also enjoyed many of their cheesecakes in the past.

We ordered the crispy crab wonton and the spicy ahi fried roll (don&amp;#39;t remember the exact name). Our appetizers cane out within 10 minutes nice, fresh, and hot. Very delicous! The crispy crap wontons just melted in your mouth after you bite through the wonton part of course and the spovy ahi fried rolls were not to spicy and tasty which came with a gyoza like dipping sauce. We also shared a Pineapple Paradise alcoholic drink where you literally drink from the pineapple. If you like a sweet, juicy, and not so strong alcoholic beverage this one is a must try. Since we wanted to save room for the cheese cake we shared the steak diane and chicken marsala (not marsala but something similar, sorry forgot the exact name again!)

Of course, we were there for Sunday for dinner around 5 p.m. and the restaurant was bustling, but he never skipped a beat. He always made sure that our water glasses were full, he packed our bread in a separate to-go container (without us even asking for one), he asked if we wanted our entrees to-go in a timely manner and he was just overall really attentive. He had lots of other parties to wait on, but I was thoroughly impressed by his service. <br&gt;<br&gt;I also wasn&amp;#39;t expecting to get seated so quickly--even though we had a small party--but I think we only had to wait for 5-10 minutes. That was record timing!<br&gt;<br&gt;My parents never deviate too much from our Cheesecake Factory favorites, but everything tasted even better that night because of the great service. Here&amp;#39;s what we got:<br&gt;<br&gt;&amp;#34;Fried Macaroni and Cheese&amp;#34;: This gooey, cheesy mac and cheese mixture gets even better when deep fried and covered with a thin, crispy crumb layer. Cheese simply oozes out of the shell with every bite (truly a must for cheese lovers). The four mac and cheese balls are served with a creamy marinara sauce (not a very strong tomatoey taste) and bits of shredded cheese on top.This dish can be found under the &amp;#34;Appetizers&amp;#34; portion of the menu. It&amp;#39;s great for sharing if your tablemates love mac and cheese ... or, if you&amp;#39;re like me, it&amp;#39;s perfect as an entr\u00e9e because it&amp;#39;s just that good. <br&gt;<br&gt;&amp;#34;Chicken Madeira&amp;#34;: This chicken dish is famous as the eatery&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;most popular chicken dish.&amp;#34; Flavorful and savory, this one is definitely a winner. The dish contains a couple pieces of tender, saut\u00e9ed chicken breast topped generously with melted Mozzarella cheese and pieces of asparagus. It&amp;#39;s also covered with flavorful mushroom Madeira sauce and is served with fluffy mashed potatoes. Both of my parents usually get this dish; they like it so much that they never want to try anything else! My mom really likes the savory mashed potatoes, and both of my parents enjoy how much cheese and mushrooms top the tender chicken breast. <br&gt;<br&gt;&amp;#34;Adam&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple&amp;#34;: This decadent dessert features the original cheesecake in an Oreo Cookie crust and includes caramel, chunks of Butterfingers and Reese&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Cups, and peanut butter throughout. My dad always orders this cheesecake, and I always benefit because I can bank on having a bite--or two--while ordering my own cheesecake. Although I&amp;#39;ve tried several of the different ones on the menu, &amp;#34;Adam&amp;#39;s&amp;#34; still reigns as one of my favorites. In fact, sometimes both dad AND I order the exact same thing for dessert. He always gets his with coffee, though, since it&amp;#39;s really, really sweet. I usually eat mine straight up, and my favorite part is the dollop of creamy peanut butter on top.<br&gt;<br&gt;&amp;#34;OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake&amp;#34;: Though I prefer the original version of this cheesecake (and want it to return), I was glad to try this slight rendition. This cheesecake differs from the original OREO one because it includes a layer of moist fudge cake and OREO cookie mousse atop the cheesecake. It&amp;#39;s similar to the original in that it has OREO cookies baked into the creamy layer of cheesecake and is topped with a milk chocolate icing. I had mixed feelings about this cheesecake and preferred the original just because I was not a huge fan of the mousse layer (I don&amp;#39;t like mousse in general ... nothing against this cheesecake). But, I really liked the layer of moist, fudgy chocolate cake interspersed with the layer of cheesecake (similar to my favorite &amp;#34;Reese&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter&amp;#34; cheesecake), and the OREO cookie chunks baked into the cheesecake itself is probably my favorite component of the entire dessert. If the mousse layer were eliminated, I would have no problem with this cheesecake being on the menu instead of the original OREO creation. It took some guts for me to deviate from my usual &amp;#34;Adam&amp;#39;s&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Reese&amp;#39;s&amp;#34; cheesecake, but in the end, I was glad that I tried something different. <br&gt;<br&gt;&amp;#34;Hershey&amp;#39;s Chocolate Bar Cheesecake&amp;#34;: My mom decided to get something different in terms of dessert and opted for this Hershey&amp;#39;s cheesecake. It&amp;#39;s one that we both always wanted to try, but never took a chance on because we always get the same thing. This chocolaty creation features Hershey&amp;#39;s cheesecake between moist chocolate cake and comes topped with creamy chocolate frosting and chocolate chips. A true delight for the pure chocoholic! I think I ended up liking this cheesecake more than my mom, who said it was a bit too chocolaty for her. I liked the fact that the cheesecake and chocolate cake were interspersed, so it actually cut down on the sweetness. My mom thought it would have been more effective if the original cheesecake layer was used in between layers of the chocolate cake, and Hershey&amp;#39;s bar chunks were inc", "rating": 5, "date": "9/7/2015"}, {"text": "Great for a large group. \u00a0 High enough table turnover that they can handle parties if 6, or 8, or 10 without missing a beat.<br&gt;<br&gt;Pretty good food. \u00a0Nothing is a home run, but every thing is respectable. \u00a0Lots of variety on the menu, so everyone is sure to find something they want.<br&gt;<br&gt;Parking is easy, 2 hours free with validation, just $1 an hour after that.<br&gt;<br&gt;Highly recommend for birthdays, or after graduation, or anytime the whole extended family is gathering together.", "rating": 3, "date": "5/17/2014"}, {"text": "This is probably my favourite place for Cheesecake Factory.

Secondly, when we were ordering our food she didn&amp;#39;t repeat our orders back to us, so when we received our meal it was wrong.

But it&amp;#39;s great when you don&amp;#39;t know what you want, because there is a little of everything. <br&gt;We finally decided on two burgers. Real original, I know.

A manager was over by our side promptly, \u00a0apologizing for the food taking longer than expected. He told us that when we finished our burgers that desert was on them and even if we were full to order it to go. <br&gt;While we waited for our burgers, another patron was talking to the bartender as if he knew her and his laugh was contagious. He seemed funny and someone full of spunk and stories. So we decided to send him over a shot. He was awesome and came to thank us. :)<br&gt;Our burgers came!!! Yeah! The food itself was good. Nothing over the top, cooked to the temp that we ordered!! <br&gt;The burgers were huge, I couldn&amp;#39;t finish mine. (which is rare) we were soooooo full!!! So, we ordered the red velvet cheesecake to go.

He wasn&amp;#39;t our waiter, but he was walking by and my bf was curious to what drinks he was carrying and he took the time to stop tell us what drinks they were, what was in them, and he even suggested his favorite.

Why, you may be wondering...because I&amp;#39;ve never waited more than 3 minutes for a table!

I don&amp;#39;t know why she thought that four women, three of which have poor eye sight, would be fine sitting in a round corner booth with barely any light. Sure some may think that dimming lights make for an &amp;#39;Intimate Experience&amp;#39;...blah! Not here! It does not look classy to see ladies pulling out their phones to use the flashlight to read the menu! Even after asking the waitress if they could brighten up the lights in the corner or if they had any glasses that had an LED light, she sadly replied that the restaurant can&amp;#39;t change the lights and no light reading glasses. For this lack of light set us 10min more into searching into &amp;#39;The Cheesecake Factory Menu Book&amp;#39; for our Lunch. <br&gt;<br&gt;Appetizers to try: <br&gt;Crab &amp;amp; Artichoke Dip! Yes, everyone should try this dip that will not only make you moan because of the taste, but will feed four people very well! We attacked the toasted bread slices, which weren&amp;#39;t that much, and the squaw &amp;amp; Italian bread with the crab and artichoke dip! Even after the toasted slices were eaten, we began asking for a second helping of warm bread to place the dip in between and have a nice crab sandwich - which I also recommend trying! <br&gt;<br&gt;Soup of the Day: when I ordered my Renee&amp;#39;s lunch special (chicken and almond salad sandwich with a small baby green salad with blue cheese dressing and a bowl of soup); the soup which was called, &amp;#34;Spicy Mexican Chicken Soup with cheese and crispy tortilla strips&amp;#34;. This is must try! The closest to this soup in taste is at Chili&amp;#39;s - but this clearly out bests Chili&amp;#39;s. After one spoonful and I ate the whole bowl of soup before I even touched my salad and sandwich! The soup was very tasty, the Spicy - meaning full of spices because it wasn&amp;#39;t hot in rector scale but pipping hot in temperature. This soup can be eaten on a cool Fall evening on a porch staring out into the sunset! Yes, I would definitely go back just for the soup! <br&gt;<br&gt;Entrees to try that will make you content - <br&gt;Fish &amp;amp; Chips<br&gt;Factory Meatloaf <br&gt;Fettuccine Alfredo <br&gt;Renee&amp;#39;s Lunch Special<br&gt;<br&gt;And of course the cheesecake!

With over 400 on staff, they seat between 4,000 and 5,000 people PER DAY. \u00a0That alone amazed us. The efficiency of this place is astounding.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our server said that one of the first things they did was have several get togethers with tons of free food. \u00a0There isn&amp;#39;t another Cheesecake Factory nearby so they couldn&amp;#39;t transfer the inventory. Corporate gave it all away to the staff. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;Secondly, they took care of them financially. \u00a0Granted, with the numbers they push through here, it wasn&amp;#39;t practical to let everyone go and then re-hire and attempt to train again in a month, so paying everyone while the restaurant was inoperable was really the best business decision.<br&gt;<br&gt;Still, corporate is to be commended on their fairness. \u00a0They averaged their employees last six weeks of 2012 including tips and came up with a weekly salary. \u00a0In addition, they also allowed for you to cash in vacation time if you so desired.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our server said some employees grumbled, thinking they should have gotten more but not him. He thought it was more than fair and even took the opportunity to take his family on vacation.<br&gt;<br&gt;My wife and I could not speak highly enough about this Cheesecake Factory. \u00a0The food. The service. The atmosphere (patio, early seating) and the way in which they took care of their staff....all outstanding!<br&gt;<br&gt;Oh, and this night&amp;#39;s dinner? \u00a0Delicious as always.

It&amp;#39;s the same menu! Anyway, the Waikiki location of the Cheesecake Factory is simply another restaurant for me that offers an insanely large menu, decent service, and a nice ambiance. It doesn&amp;#39;t offer anything outstanding (beside an outstandingly LONG wait time for a table), however at the same time the food and service certainly doesn&amp;#39;t disappoint. <br&gt;<br&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start off with the obvious, if you during the lunch or dinner rush, be prepared to wait and wait for a table. It is a rather large location, however the masses come and it can be quite a bit of wait for a table and they do not take reservations. <br&gt;<br&gt;The menu is large and will please any palate. It is by far the largest menu selection I have ever come across (and build it yourself burger combination&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t count). However, if I&amp;#39;m paying for my meal, I really don&amp;#39;t want to see ads in the menu for local establishments, nice marketing touch, but a little un-classy in my book. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food is decent, however there are only a few highlights for me. The fried macaroni and cheese is heaven. If there was ever a moment I could die happily from one bite of food it would be that item. Nicely cooked macaroni with the perfect blend of cheeses and coated in a perfected layer of bread crumbs and deep fried, what is not to like about that! Their shepherd&amp;#39;s pie is pretty good and I have to say I was rather impressed with the perfect blend of meats and vegetables to mashed potato ratio along with the homestyle flavors that come through. Everything else on the menu I&amp;#39;ve had such as the chinese chicken salad and their burgers and sandwiches are all decent, however nothing outstanding or noteworthy. Oh, note, the portions are pretty good sized, so if you have an appetite, you certainly can get your money&amp;#39;s worth.<br&gt;<br&gt;Now, that&amp;#39;s out of the way, let&amp;#39;s be honest. You came to the CHEESECAKE factory for cheesecake? It would be weird if you went there for a sundae in my book. Anyway, the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake is bites of heaven if the mood for chocolate strikes you. The texture is a little heavier than your standard cheesecake, however the rich and bold chocolate flavors will certainly put a buckle in your knees. Try the Dulce De Leche cheesecake if the mood for caramel strikes you or perhaps the Strawberry if you want something sweeter. Note, the strawberries they put on are large and amazingly good. The Chocolate Raspberry Truffle is a nice blend if you want something sweet and savory and the Oreo cheesecake is perfect for the cookie lover in us all. Did I mention I like cheesecake...<br&gt;<br&gt;Service is good with the wait staff being extremely pleasant and generally speaking very attentive. It has been rare that my water has gotten close to empty and they are quick to check in on you and the food arrives in a wonderful orchestration.<br&gt;<br&gt;Parking is available in the Royal Hawaiian Center lot and it is a bit of walk from the garage, but they validate for up to two hours. The ambiance is comfortable and while dimly lit, it serves its purpose well for group outings or that nice dinner for two. If you just want dessert and go, the cheesecake counter is right at the front of the store and you can always take your dessert out on the beach!<br&gt;<br&gt;Dessert and service are certainly extreme highlights, however it certainly doesn&amp;#39;t make up for the long wait and the so-so meal menu.", "rating": 3, "date": "3/28/2011"}, {"text": "The food and the service were excellent.

You don&amp;#39;t really need an entree with their bottomless bread basket and the size of their appetizers. But they have a large selection of entrees so it appeals more to the picky eater. Also their entrees are good, being from New York its hard to find pizza out here that I actually will order again. Their portions are large so it&amp;#39;s almost worth the price.

Come in at lunch time for sizeable portions for a bit less. And trust me, you&amp;#39;ll still get your fill, considering you&amp;#39;ll be eating that mandatory dessert right? On top of the listed choices, meals such as the salmon have different flavoring! And they&amp;#39;re very accommodating if you&amp;#39;re allergic or wanting that extra sauce. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now onto the cheesecakes - my suggestions:<br&gt;<br&gt;For those that want a light, but neutral flavor cheesecake that goes well even when you&amp;#39;re full - the vanilla bean cheesecake. In fact, I would have to put it in my top 3 cheesecakes because it&amp;#39;s delicious and very satisfying.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you want something fruity and familiar, my absolute favorite - dutch apple streusel cheesecake. My favorite because I love dutch apple pie and it&amp;#39;s not overly sweet, despite having caramel in it. The nuts and cinnamon dutch pie crumbs help to keep the sweetness in check. A definite win.<br&gt;<br&gt;Want something sour? KEY LIME. Prepare to have your face implode. If you like sour, but not painful sour, the mango key lime pie is a better choice.<br&gt;<br&gt;Chocolate lover? The Godiva or new Oreo cheesecake is very delicious.<br&gt;<br&gt;Random dessert? I suggest the Chocolate Truffle Tower Cake. Not a cheesecake but enormous and very flavorful. <br&gt;<br&gt;It does not receive a full 5-stars because it is exclusively in Waikiki and locals, such as myself, must travel from the other side of the island to enjoy the delicacies that is heaven.", "rating": 4, "date": "8/2/2013"}, {"text": "This place always has a very long line outside.

I&amp;#39;m usually not a big fan of filling up on carbs but there was a good variety to choose from here. Each ready-to-split piece was quite chewy and moist. Easy on the butter if you can help it though since generally there is a lot to come.<br&gt;<br&gt;The French Country Salad came with mixed greens, grilled asparagus, beets, goat cheese, candied pecans, and vinaigrette. The acidity from the vinaigrette is what made all the other ingredients stand out. Each bite was quite tasty but I wish there were a few more beets to be found since they were claimed to be so fresh.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Parmesan-Herb Crusted Chicken was a plate of saut\u00e9ed chicken breasts coated with parmesan-garlic. On the outside these looked like cute hamburger patties but they were actually made of kitchen. The sauce had unfortunately sploshed around on my plate by the time it arrived which soiled the presentation a bit. Taste-wise, the bread crumbs added a nice texture but the chicken was a bit dry in some places. There was enough sauce to compensate, but I don&amp;#39;t think this sauce compensation should be a long-term solution.<br&gt;<br&gt;My favourite plate of the evening was the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. This was a mixed plate of shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and garlic simmered in a spicy cajun style broth with cream and topped with steamed white rice. This was a very exciting dish as it came, though I feel the herb bits scattered around the white rim of the plate should have been kept to the middle ring. This tasted great though! The meats were all cooked very well and while the other two dishes were a bit of a miss for me, this gumbo was good enough to salvage any meal.", "rating": 3, "date": "3/13/2016"}, {"text": "We have travelled throughout the USA, if you want consistent great food, go to The Cheese Cake Factory !", "rating": 4, "date": "12/10/2017"}, {"text": "Pros:<br&gt;<br&gt;-Every single dish I&amp;#39;ve tried here are quite tasty.

The server was very good. <br&gt;<br&gt;After going over the menu several times, it&amp;#39;s 17-20 pages long. I ordered the &amp;#34;skinnylisious&amp;#34; salad/w chicken. My husband ordered the factory burger. My salad could&amp;#39;ve fed 3 or 4 people. My only gripe is there was hardly any chicken in it! For $19 I would at least expect 4-6oz of it. That kind of bummed me out. I&amp;#39;ve had this salad at other locations and it was generous. \u00a0Couldn&amp;#39;t eat all greens, I dug through it thinking there was chicken in the bottom. ZERO! Oh well. <br&gt;<br&gt;My hubby&amp;#39;s burger was good but he gave it a 7 out of 10. He&amp;#39;s a burger lover. Says his fav is Five Guys (you can adjust your scale from there). <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered the Lemon meringue cheesecake. We only had a couple bites cause we were kinda full and got the rest to go.

I want my food to taste good when I get it!<br&gt;<br&gt;I USUALLY get the shrimp scampi... BUT... the last time I ate here... I ate about half of it, and then had to run to the bathroom to THROW IT UP. YES, THROW IT UP. And NO, I WASN&amp;#39;T pregnant. LOL. Now I can&amp;#39;t even remember the last time I ate out in a restaurant and actually had to VOMIT in their bathroom.

My absolute favorite appetizer! They NEVER mess this up! Our friends got the fried mac and cheese which I took a tiny bite of (it was okay)... too heavy for me...<br&gt;<br&gt;So since you read my lovely story on how I&amp;#39;ll never ever order my ex fave shrimp scampi... I opted to try something new. I HATE trying something new because usually I don&amp;#39;t like it... sigh... such is life of a picky eater! Since the chicken madeira is supposedly the number one chicken dish on the menu (which is a BOOK) I opted for that paired with the steak diane... as well as garlic mashed potatoes. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our food was out in a reasonable time... oh wait my boyfriend ordered the steak diane paired with shrimp scampi (cringe)... <br&gt;<br&gt;His food he liked... although he ordered his steak medium rare and it came out medium WELL... after telling our waiter this he told a manager who then came by to apologize (not his fault) and state he&amp;#39;d get a new steak out right away... it came out fairly quickly and it was cooked perfectly (so my boyfriend says... I mean I&amp;#39;m all for medium... I don&amp;#39;t like my beef as mooing as he does!)<br&gt;<br&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s my food... so my steak diane was cooked medium and it tasted okay... nothing spectacular... but the chicken madeira was a FLAT piece of TENDER chicken which had THE FUNKIEST taste I&amp;#39;ve ever had on chicken. (((sitting here perplexed))) There was also 3 asparagus tips on top (I HATE asparagus)... which made it that much more unappealing. I gave it a bite... and well, it was BLAND, WEIRD, and I&amp;#39;m telling you... FUNKY is the best word to describe it. I sat there thinking how the hell this damn piece of chicken was THE most popular item on their menu?! SMH... <br&gt;<br&gt;The garlic mash... (cough cough)... was BEYOND salty! I&amp;#39;m NOT a fan of salt, but this was as if they added a tablespoon of salt instead of a dash of salt... everyone at the table tried the mash and they ALL agreed it was hella salty. SIGH. The other options of starch didn&amp;#39;t quite interest me so I played it safe with french fries to sub out.... I mean you can&amp;#39;t get french fries wrong can you?! They came out just fine. <br&gt;<br&gt;I was TEMPTED to send the chicken back... because it SUCKED... and it tasted FUNKY... and it looked FLAT and SAD... BUT I was so over all the food issues that I just wanted to be an 8 year old and play with my food (the chicken) as I had no interest in eating it. The waiter was conscious of me playing with it and asked how it tasted (I was honest) and he was kind enough to ask if I wanted something else but I declined... playing with the chicken kept me occupied while everyone else ate and while I waited for my dessert...<br&gt;<br&gt;FINALLY something good... fresh strawberries with the original cheesecake. Can&amp;#39;t mess that up. And we got a red velvet cheesecake. Very dense but very delicious.

I have to admit the semi-upscale chain restaurant is pretty nice, but the menu is just insane. The menu is pretty much on steroids, literally! There&amp;#39;s just way too much choices to choose from, but hey locals and tourists alike love to have LOTS of variety.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been to the Cheesecake factory multiple times but this past Wednesday was just ridiculous. I went with a party of 15 people (normally my party would be a table of 2)...yes I know it was partially our fault but it was crazy! We pretty much waited a little over an hour to be seated and another half an hour for our food to come out.<br&gt;<br&gt;Because of the super-sized menu, I always order something different. This time I tried the California Cheesesteak <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=VTWSWZlEX2tZu9Yv2xXD2w&amp;amp;select=Y3XJvB0Ij1SA6rb3wUD7BA\"&gt;yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a&gt; for $12.95. The cheesesteak was flavorful and the bread/fries were hot, but what really irked me was the fact that half my cheesesteak wasn&amp;#39;t even in my sandwich! Look at my pic! Half of it was on my plate! I was pretty salty but what made my mood lighten up was seeing my friend trying to eat her soft shell tacos <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=VTWSWZlEX2tZu9Yv2xXD2w&amp;amp;select=7nZnGSmSl2lCDedt7FxAYA\"&gt;yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a&gt;. As she tried to pick up a taco it just broke, leaving her with a taco shell that looked like a donut! The then had the same thing happen with her remaining 3 tacos forcing her to eat her tacos with a fork.<br&gt;<br&gt;What redeemed them was their delicious (semi-expensive) cheesecake. For about $8 you can get a slice of one of the many different cheesecakes they carry. The two cheesecakes I got to try was the fresh strawberry cheesecake <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=VTWSWZlEX2tZu9Yv2xXD2w\"&gt;yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a&gt;, and the chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake. The fresh strawberry cheesecake was good but come on, its just cheesecake with strawberries and strawberry sauce. The tuxedo cream however was pretty amazing! If you love chocolate, this hits the spot! There&amp;#39;s a layer of chocolate, a layer of cheesecake, and a layer of chocolate cake. Making the perfect proportion for cake, cheesecake, and chocolate in a single bite. <br&gt;<br&gt;Two and half hours and about 5,000 calories later I still don&amp;#39;t really like the Cheesecake factory. I haven&amp;#39;t been here since last Halloween and who knows maybe I won&amp;#39;t be back till next year. If you&amp;#39;re up for an hour+ wait by all means hit up the Cheesecake Factory.

Sammy and Hua have been to the Restaurant before and just loved it. Sammy had the Chicken Madeira Hua and I we...nt with the Fettuccini Alfredo and Tristin had a plain charbroiled Hamburger.<br&gt;<br&gt;Sammy and Tristin&amp;#39;s food was great Hua and I not so great. The Alfredo was extremely salty we just could not eat it so we sent it back. We got two new orders a little bit better but still to salty Hua sent hers back I decide to try and eat mine and asked for more bread to help cover the saltiness. Bread, water, even bear could not cover the saltiness.<br&gt;<br&gt;The reason I am writing this is because even though my first experience was not very good I am willing to give it one more try because of how we were treated. When we sent back the first order Wayne (sorry did not get last name) came to our table and apologized and explained what they though might have been the problem and reassured us a new order would be out shortly. Wayne was apologetic, he empathized and really showed that they care about there customers. He offered to bring out complementary drinks or food to make up for the problem. The second time he came out to talk to us again nothing but professionalism. That is the reason I will give it another try I really believe that statements made that it is the bomb is true and this was just a fluke.<br&gt;<br&gt;One comment maybe Wayne should spend some time with the waitress Tammie she needs a little help in being more attentive to her customer even if it is an 8 year old. she was good at letting wayne know about what happened with the food we sent back, but that was about it!! she would ask a question but we never finished asking while she just walked away from us.

I got the wild blueberry white chocolate cheesecake which is my all time favorite. \u00a0I really goes well with the blueberry mojito I must say. \u00a0Our whole time spent there was about 4 hours total. \u00a0We got out right around 9:30PM. \u00a0Some side notes, in regards to location, you can&amp;#39;t really miss Cheesecake Factory, there will always be people waiting around the restaurant and it&amp;#39;s within the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Plaza area. \u00a0They really have the ambiance set low when dining in especially at night, you will need a flashlight to browse through the menu. \u00a0I don&amp;#39;t like how they don&amp;#39;t have prices listed specifically for certain things like the individual cocktails and cheesecakes. \u00a0Coming into here reminds me of Liliha Bakery, you also have to wait and there&amp;#39;s always a crowd for cheesecake.", "rating": 3, "date": "10/6/2014"}, {"text": "Definitely very good...

We always would order the combo platter (sauces to die for) of Steak Diane/Shrimp Scampi. We&amp;#39;ve been ordering this dish all over the country (as we are travelers) and it is outstanding. Now a change??? You see it used to be with the side of mashed potatoes you could exchange for free the fettuccine Alfredo. This goes much better with it anyway!!! NOW they charge $3.99 if you want to trade! Bad. THEN they change the steak. It used to be 3 nice medallions of steak. Tender, great cut. Now it&amp;#39;s only a few little &amp;#34;hunks&amp;#34; of meat. Barely a bite for approx. $22. Sooo we are now not ordering that favorite meal anymore. CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHY??? <br&gt;<br&gt;Next the good news... kinda... we had a very bad experience with a waiter. Short, nasty, clumping the plate down, cold food -- we were told by another staff member he left the food on the line because he HAD to wait for our fettuccine Alfredo to be cooked.... so... he left his shift for the day. Lucky for us. We had to send the cold food back. Marshall Freedman the Manager came out and couldn&amp;#39;t have been nicer. He accommodated us this one time and did not charge the surprise $3.99 charge to change to fettuccine Alfredo. JEREMY J was our new waiter.

I ain&amp;#39;t down for supper, I want dinner. My niece is late - YAY!! <br&gt;Here she comes, 830p. and it&amp;#39;s like a movie star entering the crowd where everyone stands back to get a good look. My niece is beautiful.

In the meantime the waiter keeps asking if we&amp;#39;re ready like every five minutes when we&amp;#39;re still on page one.

I went in with my girlfriend for a 7:30 dinner time on a Thursday night. \u00a0We put our name in and 40 minutes later we sat down. I particularly don&amp;#39;t like to wait for any restaurant this wait was extra long. Overall service wasn&amp;#39;t that bad \u00a0once we actually sat down.

I always thought it was in the 20-25$ range to eat here but there are at least half the entrees within the $10-17 range. I choose a chicken club type sandwich which came out to $12 but was pretty big including the fries. \u00a0I&amp;#39;m sure everyone can easily find a good meal for $15. \u00a0One negative regarding pricing is that Cheesecake factory rarely participates in any kinds of discounts of coupons<br&gt;<br&gt;Food:<br&gt;So my sandwich tasted great, but it did come with some cost. \u00a0Nutritionally the food is horrible for you. Just look up the nutritional value \u00a0and you&amp;#39;ll see that most of the meals have all the Fat, cholesterol and sodium you&amp;#39;ll need for the entire day. \u00a0One of the negatives of my sandwich (chicken club) was that the bread was toasted and loaded with butter.

(And they are open till 12, so late night eats are always an option here!)<br&gt;<br&gt;Although I can never imagine taking the menu test to wait tables here, I think its safe to say that there is truly something on the menu for everyone! If you can&amp;#39;t find something to order here, you probably should never leave home! Seriously, pasta, sandwiches, salads, tacos, fresh fish, you name it, they got it! And being that they are so corporate, the food is consistently good, no matter what you order. My favorite of late has been the blackened chicken sandwich with a green salad instead of fries (although they do offer sweet potato fries which are highly temping!). The sandwich is massive--as in I usually take half of it home--and costs less than $12! Can&amp;#39;t complain about that! Their salads are yummy too, but I know from experience that the lunch size portions available in the daytime are much more managable!<br&gt;<br&gt;So if you want to brave the crowds (normally a 50/50 mix of Japanese tourists and and mainlands tourists too scared to branch out and try a restaurant they don&amp;#39;t have back home...) the Cheesecake factory is usually a tasty choice.

I would have really appreciated if they just told us up front how long the wait would be instead of sugar coating it, then we would have choose another place to satisfy our hungriness! <br&gt;<br&gt;So we get buzzed then we have to wait again to get seated! seriously I guess there are different levels of waiting.. <br&gt;Level 1- Waiting outside, making sure that your stomach is really empty!<br&gt;Level 2- Wait for Host, now you really need to eat be cause you already waited 2 hours and you can smell the aroma of the food and see all the food passing from the kitchen to the customers. <br&gt;Leve 3- Waiter, I am already going to automatically get 18% so I can do a shitty job, its required anyway! <br&gt;<br&gt;Really???<br&gt;We get to our table and we there aren&amp;#39;t enough chairs, so we politely ask for an open table next to us so we can combine it, the manager for the night says that we can use the table all the way on the other side of the room, which is the same exact amount of chairs a few feet away from us.

Their menu items are vast and mostly original. Their menu is so large, in fact, that you&amp;#39;ll be certain to overlook a lot of things that might spark your interest. I know I did.<br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered their &amp;#34;Thai Lettuce Wraps&amp;#34; which came with assorted vegetables, strips of chicken satay and coconut curry noodles along with peanut, sweet red chili and tamarind-cashew dipping sauce. This was my favorite dish out of everything we ordered since it was absolutely monstrous and rather flavorful (as long as you used the dipping sauces). I can say that I didn&amp;#39;t much taste the coconut curry noodles and the only sauce that was worth my time was the peanut sauce, but other than that this dish was remarkable.<br&gt;<br&gt;Next came the &amp;#34;Fried Macaroni and Cheese&amp;#34; which was surprisingly good. It&amp;#39;s coated in a thin, slightly crispy bread coating and sprinkled with cheese. Breaking into the sphere of goodness, the cheese pulls apart from the edges like it does in those pizza commercials. The flavor was incredible; having a sharpness that tells you it&amp;#39;s homemade, though the marinara sauce seemed to be the parsley of the dish.<br&gt;<br&gt;My friend ordered a side of garlic mashed potatoes, claiming it was the best he ever had. Meh. I&amp;#39;ve definitely had better and their potatoes I found to be lacking proper seasoning (a bit of salt and pepper fixed that). I&amp;#39;d give this dish a pass unless you&amp;#39;re really craving starches.<br&gt;<br&gt;The final thing we ordered (besides dessert and drinks, but that&amp;#39;s later) was their &amp;#34;Firecracker Salmon&amp;#34;. Now, I&amp;#39;ve made &amp;#34;Firecracker Salmon&amp;#34; as fillets for dinner, and I can say that I&amp;#39;m rather disappointed at the absolutely tiny portions we received and the stunning lack of flavor. It&amp;#39;s more fizzle than firework. We got four pieces of salmon wrapped in fried wonton skins. The whole thing was about as thick as my thumb and not much longer (see: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NXAt_BOrUSCHuCR6pvY_Iw?select=NncYLS0A8Uz5OYe0zuylyg\"&gt;yelp.com/biz_photos/NXAt\u2026</a&gt;). It was served on a mountain of shredded purple cabbage. I felt like we were paying $13 to get $10 in cabbage and $3 in salmon. The sauce it was served with initially has no flavor, but then the heat arrives and soon departs. It&amp;#39;s delicious for the few seconds where you can taste anything, but other than that the dish is a total flop. For the price, I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend it.<br&gt;<br&gt;For dessert we ordered we ordered the key lime cheesecake which tasted almost exactly like a key lime pie. Their whipped cream was made with real cream (because they whipped it too much and it had the faint taste of butter) and topped with a thin slice of lime. They had two giant scoops of vanilla ice cream on the side and I can only imagine how amazing it would have tasted with chocolate sauce. I suggest you get it with coffee, because having the bitterness of the coffee right after the tartness of the cheesecake is divine (although my friend said it sounded gross).<br&gt;<br&gt;My friend got their &amp;#34;Pomegranate Mojito&amp;#34;, which looked delicious. Just as a warning, he said it was super strong and was later intoxicated for the rest of the evening. Then again, he&amp;#39;s a lightweight so...<br&gt;<br&gt;Service:<br&gt;Aside from the absolutely ridiculous wait, the service here is good. The waiters are patient and professional. They don&amp;#39;t hover and they&amp;#39;re not constantly interrupting your meal. They see that you need a refill of something and get it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Atmosphere:<br&gt;I had the misfortune of sitting right next to their live performers, which made conversation next to possible. I guess that no matter where you sit in the restaurant, it&amp;#39;ll be loud. The lighting is rather dim and very orange, which makes photographing food very difficult and next to impossible to color correct, but that&amp;#39;s a photographer&amp;#39;s complaint. Other than that, it&amp;#39;s reasonably enjoyable.<br&gt;<br&gt;Price:<br&gt;The prices here are definitely a bit spendy. Although you can get some good values (e.g. Thai Lettuce Wraps), I feel like you&amp;#39;ll miss more than hit with a lot of the things you&amp;#39;ll find on the menu. When I looked at the bill and saw that my friend&amp;#39;s drink had cost $11, I gasped and nearly had a heart attack.

My husband was shocked at the size of his sandwich. Portions are definitely large enough to share. Service was a little slow, but she was very friendly and checked on us frequently.

They never taste as good as they sound, but I will share some highlights of the menu: <br&gt;<br&gt;--Appetizer sampler. . . so big, but great<br&gt;--Avocado eggrolls<br&gt;--Thai lettuce wraps<br&gt;--French Country Salad<br&gt;--Napa Burger<br&gt;--Fish Tacos<br&gt;<br&gt;And my favorite cheesecakes--<br&gt;--Chocolate Tuxedo Cream<br&gt;--Brownie Sundae<br&gt;--Tiramisu <br&gt;<br&gt;And I often order one of the many chocolate cake slices--they are SO big. . . you can eat them for days (for real!) at home. . .

The first being the wait. Do not be surprised if they tell you the wait is over an hour. It is a busy restaurant in a tourist location. Second, their menu can be quite overwhelming. It is too large and can take a person quite a bit of time just to go over their dinner options. I think that they could benefit trimming down the amount of dishes they offer, but since they are already an established chain I doubt that will happen. The lighting is also very dim in there. It&amp;#39;s quite dark for a restaurant. Also, if you are ordering for kids, they put a lot of pepper on the vegetables. The carrots were too spicy for a kids menu item, so you may want to request no pepper for the little ones.<br&gt; \u00a0Overall the experience was fine, but nothing special. It is the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. If that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re looking for, you got it!

Its seems a little more classy in Hawaii than some of the mainland ones I&amp;#39;ve visited. <br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0First thing I completely dislike about this place is the droves of tourists standing in line or clogging up the aisle ways. \u00a0arggh...why would you eat at someplace you already have in your home state?

There are so many other places to eat in Hawaii. \u00a0Even in the tourist trap called Waikiki. \u00a0Its like if I went to Arizona or Idaho to eat Hawaiian food. <br&gt; \u00a0 Food is good but you get Waikiki prices for restaurant chain food. I have had the Steak Diane and Shrimp scampi. \u00a0I felt these were two good and solid food items. \u00a0I was kind of surprised that there was more mashed potatoes than the main entrees. \u00a0The Shrimp Scampi was a different from what I&amp;#39;m used to. \u00a0A butter and cream sauce with tomatoes and parsley. It had maybe a little to much parsley but it was good. The shrimp had a nice crust to it. \u00a0The steak was cooked to a middle rare and tasted pretty good. Overall pretty good solid meal. I do admit its a little more classy in Hawaii than the others I&amp;#39;ve been to in the mainland. \u00a0The presentation seems different and even the quality. \u00a0I could be wrong. <br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0The cheesecake is pretty uniform everywhere. \u00a0I liked the Apple Strudel, Mac Nut and Key Lime. \u00a0I think I could avoid the Key Lime. \u00a0They whip the cream cheese to like a key lime pie. \u00a0I rather have a key lime pie. \u00a0My absolute favorite here is the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake. \u00a0Cheesecake=Good and Pineapple Upside down Cake = Good.

BUT, there are degrees and this little Cheesecake Factory is officially my FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD. I can go to the most expensive places, but in the end, this is what i love the most. the food is just so good. No matter what I order I want to just eat the plate too. And since the plates are huge, I always end up with a bit of a stomach ache because I&amp;#39;m too small to eat that much. But even with that stomach ache, I&amp;#39;m so happy cuz it&amp;#39;s so DELICIOUSSSSIEJOIEWJOJ!!! :D) Their 4 cheese pasta is perfection. And all the sandwiches I&amp;#39;ve tried have just been so lovely. And their mango smoothie is so nice too. When I tried to take my family there they were like &amp;#34;we dont wanna go to no factory. We want Chili&amp;#39;s!&amp;#34; Where I come from, it&amp;#39;s practically a village- so it&amp;#39;s always big deal where to eat when we have a family vacation to a civilization! \u00a0But since they had no idea what they were talkin&amp;#39; about, I was like, &amp;#34;NOO!! WE HAVE TO!!&amp;#34;. And so all grumblin&amp;#39;, they went in and oh boyy did they get hit with happiness! I forgot what my sisters got, but they were just happy as heck. The great thing about this place is that they have so many options that everyone will surely be fattened up and happy. And their cheesecakes are the best in the world.

I give them 5 stars for that, not many places can pull that off. Our food was fabulous too!", "rating": 5, "date": "9/26/2010"}, {"text": "It is Halloween night in Waikiki and been trying to get a dinner reservation to eat dinner here since Friday. They refuse to take phone reservation so they advise you to go personally. As a LOCAL and new transplant from the mainland, my husband and I decided to go tthere personally and make reservation. We show up and was told that they could not give us reservation way ahead of time since it is for Sunday. The girl told me to come back on Sunday and get reservation anytime \u00a0of the \u00a0day. I said okay. Today Sunday at 1130 AM, we show up to make reservation and we were denied again. We were told they will not take reservations period. I asked for the Manager. My husband and I spoke to the Manager and he told \u00a0us to come back between 5:30-6:00 pm tonight and there should not be a problem getting a dinner reservation . We showed up at the appointed time of 5:45pm and were \u00a0again DENIED. Unbelievable. I have never experienced this in my entire life!!! \u00a0My blood pressure is now sky rocketing. I told the girl in the front that I had spoken with the \u00a0day manager, described his appearance. She told Me that there are 4 managers with the same appearance. She IMPLIED AND made me feel like I was lying. That I DID NOT appreciate. I asked for the \u00a0Manager to clear up this mess. \u00a0We spoke to a JT and would not \u00a0honor my plea. I described to him again that I had spoken to the day manager, described to him what he looked like. \u00a0He then confirmed that such manager does exist, but JT was no help other than it will probably take 3 hours before we are seated. Unbelievable ! \u00a0We followed all the instructions they gave us, yet it resulted negatively. I asked him to take my name down or give me a pager even if it takes three hours to eat. I told him that we are locals and it is very disturbing the way we were treated. This should not happen. I will not be recommending this to my local and mainland friends and family. This was a very bad experience in which we DO NOT want to go through ever again. WE JUST WANTED TO EAT DINNER ON \u00a0A SUNDAY NIGHT, GRANTED IT WAS A HALLOWEEN NIGHT. \u00a0Can you believe the absurdity of it all? \u00a0Pathetic. \u00a0I want to talk to CORPORATE TOMORROW. Giving this place a 1 Star was being generous.", "rating": 1, "date": "11/1/2010"}, {"text": "This one is probably the best cheesecake factory in the country and I could care less if I was wrong. Of course, waiting part is definitely pain in the butt and I want to give 3 stars for their poor waiting list system. They either page too early or clerks have no desire to organize system because the front area was just way \u00a0too crowded with the people that have been paged and it reminded me of a fish market I saw on TV. But let&amp;#39;s get back to the positive sides. Our server was very friendly without any fake attitude and his jokes were real. LOL And I had the BEST mojito EVER. Who would&amp;#39;ve ever thought you could get the best mojito at Cheesecake Factory??? I had a passion fruit mojito and I might go later just for that. I wish I could have another one but I had a very early flight next morning. :( Buffalo wings and fried calamari we had as appetizers were pretty good. I took a bite of a green chile burger my friend had and I was IMPRESSED!!! And I had cajun jambalaya pasta and the words cant describe best how good it was. I am the biggest fan of Creole food and a lot of places like to play with the word, &amp;#39;spicy&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;hot&amp;#39; and I always need to have extra hot sauce or crushed red pepper on deck but whoaaa boy, this one right here??? It had a very delightful kick to it and", "rating": 4, "date": "1/12/2011"}, {"text": "If you don&amp;#39;t mind waiting and want to be overwhelmed by a huge variety of choices to soothe your cravings then this is a one stop shop. \u00a0They have pastas to burgers, to fish to steak from salads to desserts. \u00a0One thing is remind yourself to bring your &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; game appetite with you as they do not give your portion control meal sizes but more like huge-gang-gious enormous portions which surely you will need to be rolled out of the place. \u00a0Most often known for their yummy fluffy cheesecakes this restaurant is sure to please you. \u00a0I recommend their lettuce wraps to start since that is more on the light side, for the main meal the salmon is good. \u00a0(BTW- Cheesecake Factory WHYYY??? Did you discontinue the Pad Thai Noodles. \u00a0That was my favorite and it was so YUMMY!) And you must, must, must save room for Cheesecake. \u00a0MY all time favorite, hands down...and will definitely for go any thoughts of a diet is their Key Lime Pie Cheesecake with of course EXTRA Whipped Cream DOH! That will surely complete any meal. \u00a0Also, for those of you who need a alcoholic beverage to swallow down your meal they have a full bar too.", "rating": 3, "date": "6/22/2010"}, {"text": "Went at 4PM on a Sat night with a group of 12. \u00a0We arrived late so the rest were already seated. \u00a0The noise level was so high that my hearing aids automatically shut down to avoid further hearing loss due. \u00a0I gave a mic to someone thinking I could at least hear what she was saying over the ambient noise. \u00a0No, that didn&amp;#39;t work either. \u00a0Finally gave up. \u00a0Made app&amp;#39;t w/ audiologist to try to program hearing aids for noisy environment and he said Cheesecake Factory is probably #1 in noise level followed closely by the Yard House. \u00a0Hey, guess where the group is meeting next month? \u00a0Hubby and I will pass next month&amp;#39;s gathering. \u00a0Food is nothing special. \u00a0Hubby had seafood jambalaya which was filling but not great. \u00a0I helped myself to a shrimp which was so overdone that it was a shame. \u00a0My hint of chicken with almond sandwich was forgettable and the soup was a disgrace. \u00a0Thought having dessert might be redeeming but didn&amp;#39;t want to chance it. \u00a0The previous time we went to Cheesecake Factory, the food was so bad we didn&amp;#39;t even take the left-overs home. \u00a0Hate to bad mouth a place on one visit but this second chance was no improvement so not willing to chance a third time. \u00a0Sorry Waikiki but Marina del Rey location was MUCH better and we could actually hear conversations rather than trying to read lips :( \u00a0Fooled us twice and there won&amp;#39;t be another chance. \u00a0SORRY....", "rating": 2, "date": "5/30/2012"}, {"text": "today my lady friend and i went to the cheese cake factory in waikiki we was amazed we did not have to wait in line we went about little after 11am when they just opened.I MUST ADMIT THE PRICES WERE HIGH BUT THE FOOD WAS ONO-LICIOUOS.....WE TRIED THE SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKE AND I MUST ADMIT IT WAS GOOD EVEN MY LADY FRIEND ENJOYED IT.......THAN AFTER THAT WE ATE THE ORIGINAL CHEESECAKE WITH STRAWBERRIES THAT WAS GOOD SE WE WERE STUFFED SO WE WALKED IT OFF AND WENT ALL OVER THE PLACE I MUST ADMIT IT WAS MY FIRST TIME I WENT TO THE ROYAL HAWAIIAN CENTER I WAS AMAZED HOW HUGE THAT PLACE WAS REALLY HIGH CLASS NOT FOR US LOCL FOLKS BUT THE STORE FOREVER 21 WAS A VEY NICE STORE AND THE PRICES WERE QUITE AVERAGE.....ANYWAY WHEN WE GOT OUT THE CHEESE CAKE FACTORY THERE WAS A LINE WAITING TO GO IN SO WIT MY RATING THOUGH THE PRICES WAS QUITE HIGHT I&amp;#39;D STILL GAVE IT A 4 STARS BECAUSE WHERE WE SAT IT WAS LIKE SNUG NEXT TO THE WALL SO DID NOT HAVE TO MUCH SPACE TO EAT....BUT THE SERVICE WAS GREAT AND THE WAITER HE KNEW WAHT TO SAY WHEN MY LADY FRIEND ASK SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FOOD SO IF YOU NVER BEEN THERE BEFORE CHECK IT OUT AND THE FOOD IS GOOD AND SO MUCH DIFFERENT THINS THAY HAD TOOK US ALMOST 30MINUTES TO DECIDE WHAT WE WANTED BUT OUR WAITER HE WAS QUITE PATIENCE.......", "rating": 4, "date": "5/10/2012"}]}
