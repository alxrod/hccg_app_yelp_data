We were gonna sit down and grab a quick bite to eat then get dessert with coffee but I obviously have never been in there on a Saturday evening about 6:30-7pm the place was packed we asked how long wait was and was a bit longer than I felt like waiting so I decided to grab a couple slices to go.

The entire front was filled with about 50 people, and 15-20 strollers. I walked in and asked how long the wait would be for 2 and she said there was no wait which was awesome. Of course we sat in a crowded area with one bench and one uncomfortable chair but beggars can&amp;#39;t be choosers. So our server came over to us almost immediately. We ordered waters while we waited to decide but didn&amp;#39;t want to spend the extra cash. The waitress forgot to bring the bread, which I reminded her. No harm, no foul but the bread is so key!!! We got Fried Mac n Cheese for an appetizer which was pretty good. I&amp;#39;d give them a 3 out of 5. I love mac and cheese, mac and cheese bites, anything to do with mac and cheese. I believe the ricotta was what threw off the taste a little. And I would have preferred 6 smaller ones than 4 larger ones but that&amp;#39;s just me being a pain. Not the best but I&amp;#39;m a sucker for mac and cheese so. For my meal I ordered the Chicken Avocado Club because I couldn&amp;#39;t commit to all of the flavors all the other dishes offer, while my mom ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. It took about 10-15 minutes to get which was great because we were starving. My mom said her pasta was spicy but delicious, she really enjoyed it. My sandwich was very good but hard to eat because of how tall it was. Then I had the Chocolate Godiva Cheesecake with Glazed Strawberries for dessert, while my mom ordered the Raspberry Lemon Cake Cheesecake? I always get the same dessert because I don&amp;#39;t want to commit to and $8 slice of something I may not like. The Raspberry Lemon Cake Cheesecake was really good. I like how the bottom half isa \u00a0cake and the top half is cheesecake. The whipped cream at TCF is too heavy for such rich cheesecakes.

I mean it&amp;#39;s the same server.<br&gt; <br&gt;We actually did get to order food before they did, which was surprising given how the server was bending over backwards for them and seemingly ignoring us. While waiting, baskets of bread kept being given to them. We had to ask for ours...more than once. Not surprisingly, their food came out first, getting it in about 10-15 minutes while we waited almost double that. How does a group of at least 10 people get all their food before a table of two when we ordered first? I&amp;#39;ll tell you how: they kept reordering cocktail which is $$$$ for the restaurant. And when they are spending that money, I guess the server doesn&amp;#39;t care much about the table right next to them that she is also serving. <br&gt;<br&gt;Extremely disappointing.

Yes, the food is decent in massive portions. But, I&amp;#39;ve had better for cheaper. And, does this nation truly need massive portions and quantities? Isn&amp;#39;t there an epidemic going on?

To avoid a large tab, I ordered the cheapest listed drink: warm caramel macchiato and an ice water. $5! \u00a0<br&gt;(I think that&amp;#39;s even cheaper than a slice of cheesecake.)

The Cheesecake Factory challenges you to stuff as much shit into your mouth as you possibly can and still have room for dessert. This place doesn&amp;#39;t make it easy because the portions of everything are stupidly huge.

But wouldn&amp;#39;t it be strange to be on a diet and have such a monstrous salad, one in which you can&amp;#39;t even see the eyes of the person sitting accross from you? Lol. I am over exaggerating. <br&gt;<br&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see, the first time I went here I went in a large group with my boyfirend and his co-workers. I ordered a virgin pina coloda.

I like to try shrimp dishes first, then beef, then chicken when I try new places. I prefer seafood over poultry. I liked my dish. I didn&amp;#39;t absolutely love it, but I was having a good time and I enjoyed the busy restaurant atmosphere and wanted to come back. I tried my boyfirend&amp;#39;s hibachi steak dish and it was not so good though. I agreed with him that it was a bit chewy and a terribly small portion. The mushroom tasted...gritty, like it wasn&amp;#39;t cleaned properly. The wasabi mash potatoes was plentiful but it was also very dry. What is the point of serving a lot of unedible mashpotatoe? I&amp;#39;d rather be served a small portion that was excellent and be left wanting more. \u00a0As for service, service was not so good. The cook messed up one of my bf&amp;#39;s co-workers order.

And a very long wait for a table.<br&gt;<br&gt;The second time I went here I went with my boyfriend and his best friend and his girlfriend. I had and liked a lot the spicy chicken chipotle pasta.

Maybe I got lucky this time and ordered the right stuff.<br&gt;<br&gt;I have tried the canjun Jambalaya pasta twice. It is absolutely spicy goodness. The first time I didn&amp;#39;t like it because my chicken was overcooked and dry, but the second time when I had it in Braintree, MA adjacent to the South Shore Mall, it was supberb.

I called 5 days before our visit to set up a reservation for 12 people and the hostess told me they do not take reservation and to come in 45 minutes before we wish to be seated. Most of us in the party know it would be at least an hour so come Sunday my sister went in to put her name on the list. She was told she would wait minimum 2 hours. She told the hostess that we called and were told to be there 45 before we wished to be seated. My sister told the hostess that we were misinformed and had planned around the information we were given before which is why we did not make a reservation. The hostess told my sister that they do not reservations because it does not benefit the restaurant and that we did not meet their requirements to their policy so we had to wait. The manager was then evolved and showed interest in accommodating us for about 10 minutes. At this point the restaurant was still not busy. He told my sister he would do everything he could to have us sat in an hour and apologized. An hour and a half later we ask the hostess if she had any idea how much longer and she told us they were just waiting for tables to clear so they can be cleaned. At this point everyone in my party was hungry and frustrated as people were coming in and being sat a lot faster then we were. One girl was pregnant and asked for a water which she never received. The manager was no where to be seen and no one came up to us to keep us updated on the status of the tables. After over two hours waiting, we decided we were going to leave. At this point the manager was at the cheesecake station ignoring us and doing work on the POS system. In the 2 hours we waited we were not offered a drink or any thing during our wait. All the staff ignored us and did not try to be friendly with us. We asked about our tables a few times and were answered rudely as if we were being annoying. After almost 2 hours and a half my sister went up to the manager and told him we had waited over two hours and that we were frustrated and we were leaving. Apparently he had forgotten about us because he spoke to my sister as if he had no idea who she was. She repeated back to him what he had told her earlier and said ok has it been that long? she replied with yes its been way longer its been over two hours. He said ok and walked away. Less than a minute later we were sat. At this point everyone in the party was already cranky and hungry. The waiter was nice and quick. However during our dinner not once did the manager come by to check on us or apologize for our inconvenience. The food came out quick but was not very good. At the end of the meal we at least expected the birthday boys dessert to be comp from a $317 tab. However we were not compensated for anything and we were shown no remorse for our inconvenience. On top of that, they brought dessert over and sang when the birthday boys were not even at the table! The 7 year old was so disappointed because that&amp;#39;s all he had waited for all night was to blow out his candle. When my sister told them this one of the servers gave her attitude and told her they could sing again if it was a huge deal. She told him to forget it. The staff seemed to be very annoyed with us and seemed even more annoyed when we told them it was someone&amp;#39;s birthday dinner.

I don&amp;#39;t hate them, exactly. I&amp;#39;ll eat at them from time to time and usually I&amp;#39;m satisfied enough with the experience. Most of them are simply unremarkable. The service is always standard. The food is decent. I can go to one and pretty much know what to expect. Some I really do dislike, though. Either their atmosphere is bad or their food is disappointing or something is just not right.<br&gt;<br&gt;Entering The Cheesecake Factory was like entering a nightmare for me. The doors are huge and heavy. The restaurant itself is gigantic, far bigger than any restaurant I&amp;#39;ve ever eaten in before. I felt like there were tables for miles around! The ceilings tower above everyone like in an airport, train station, or factory of some sort! I saw staff standing around but no one greeted us when we entered. After a few bewildering and discouraging moments, I finally noticed the desk that was sort of in the middle of the lobby and asked the attendant standing there if we were supposed to check in with him. My guess turned out to be correct, he took my name, and we found a spot to wait for a table. They really need to have that desk marked somehow or have staff waiting at the door to greet people. We were entirely ignored until we figured out how to check in.<br&gt;<br&gt;We waited less than ten minutes, I think, for a table. The hostess who led us to the table seemed lifeless, possibly annoyed that she actually had to work. Our waiter, though, turned out to be a friendly guy who seemed eager to please. <br&gt;<br&gt;The menu, frankly, is intimidating at twenty-one pages long! It goes against everything I&amp;#39;ve read about good restaurant management, where the right choice is usually to keep it short. Do a few things well, no more than three or four pages of great menu items that taste great, and people will come back over and over again. Twenty-pages, with what I&amp;#39;m told is over two hundred items, seems insane. I don&amp;#39;t know how they pull it off! They may have kidnapped Willy Wonka&amp;#39;s Oompa Loompas and put them to work in Cheesecake Factory kitchens.<br&gt;<br&gt;We both ordered peach smoothies to drink. They arrived in completely full, very large glasses and tasted absolutely delicious! I ordered the seared tuna tataki salad. Kelley ordered the crispy chicken costoletta. I&amp;#39;ve never had rare tuna before but I was feeling a little adventurous! The food didn&amp;#39;t take long to arrive, despite the place being quite busy and very large. My meal came presented very nicely, with several slices of lovely tuna (seared brown on the outside, nice and pink on the inside), four majestic slices of beef steak tomato, a bit of avocado, and a large pile of greens. The tuna tasted fantastic and felt great in my mouth. The seasoning was a little &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; for my tastes but that&amp;#39;s just personal preference. (I&amp;#39;m still working up my resistance to hot, spicy foods!) The greens, avocado, and tomato were fresh and delicious. I toned the spicy sensations from the tuna down by quickly following tuna slices with other things from my plate or eating tuna with other things at the same time. It worked well and tasted wonderful! I also tried Kelley chicken costoletta and found it excellent. The chicken was perfectly tender and tasted fantastic!<br&gt;<br&gt;Between my huge peach smoothie and my tuna tataki salad, I was stuffed to the gills when it was time for dessert. I couldn&amp;#39;t turn down the chance to try the famous Cheesecake Factory cheesecake, though. So I got a piece of the seasonal Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake to go. I just ate it, siting here at home in Maine, and found it delicious. It&amp;#39;s just what I expect cheesecake to be. I am pretty sure I&amp;#39;ve never had cheesecake with pecans, though, and now I&amp;#39;m looking forward to holiday pies, hoping pecan will be among them.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Cheesecake Factory is one of those chain restaurants I really should hate. The atmosphere definitely doesn&amp;#39;t do it for me. It really is too big and too impersonal. The service, at least at first, was really quite poor. However, the food really &amp;#34;did it&amp;#34; for me. I just looked at their menu on their website and noticed several items listed that I didn&amp;#39;t notice when looking at the menu in the restaurant. There are so many things I&amp;#39;d love to try! If all the food is as good as we got, it&amp;#39;s definitely going to be worth going back from time to time.

It was GOOD! Piping hot! Yum-O! My companion, Patty, a Co-worker, had chicken salad, which was HUGE and she loved it! We also split Crispy Crab Wontons, and they rocked! Delish! We sat at the bar, and Brett the bartender was great, so were the people sitting to my right, a husband and wife who were celebrating husband&amp;#39;s birthday. There was also a hysterically funny kid who was the runner. Lots of personality. I also like how they lay down a napkin for you when you sit at the bar to eat, as the top of the bar is some sort of granite or stone and is slippery. I would have given 5 stars but for the guy next to Patty, he was just a complaining caca head. He complained about everything from the time he sat down. He was mad that they didn&amp;#39;t have a huge chopped salad, only a small size. Kinda ruined it for me. He was just not a nice man. I hate when people blame the server for something not being offered. It&amp;#39;s probably not offered cuz only YOU would actually order it.
