Cheesecake Factory delivers the same consistently bad service and you will see the same theme in my previous post. After living in Chicago for two years and going to 300 different restaurants in the City during that time frame, this Cheesecake Factory is by far the worst restaurant in the City. I could not in good conscience recommend anyone to eat here. Customer service is nonexistent and that is far from exaggerating. I have been to this place far too many times trying to give it a chance, wanting to like it so badly, and it fails every single time whether dining in or carrying out. The first thing you have to know about this place is that you will not have a meal shorter than two hours. And if you are carrying out, expect to wait a suspiciously long time; long enough that you start to wonder if they completely forgot you placed an order. Doesn&amp;#39;t matter what you order, dining in or taking out, if you&amp;#39;re coming while the place is empty or full, or whether it is lunch, dinner, or somewhere in between. Everything from receiving drinks to finishing the meal and waiting for the bill takes a significantly long time and the pacing is horrifyingly bad. The servers are extremely inattentive. You will not see your wait staff much, and when you do, they will walk right by you without saying a word. If they do stop by your table, they will be uncomfortably rude and/or cold for no reason. <br&gt;<br&gt;We waited 20 minutes to be greeted at our table once seated, waited another 15 minutes to order because the server didn&amp;#39;t want to take our order when first greeted, an hour had gone by until we were served our entree, our bread came after we were halfway through our entree, another forty minutes had gone by until we were served our cheesecake, and another thirty minutes went by until we received the bill. We had to ask a hostess, a busboy, another server, AND the manager to get bread, cheesecake, AND our check. All SEPARATE occasions. The waitress was completely dismissive, rude, and clearly did not care about the tables she was waiting. This is not atypical for this Cheesecake Factory. This quality of service happens every single time; they go above and beyond to be consistently horrible. I have never been served by someone even remotely personable or customer service oriented at this Cheesecake Factory. Cheesecake Factory should be embarrassed of this location. It is clearly in need of serious work. The quality of service is wildly negligent.<br&gt;<br&gt;TLDR; If you are short on time/simply want to enjoy a meal within two hours time and you prefer to be waited on by someone who doesn&amp;#39;t have an attitude, do not come here. You will not have any of those things. Not a single one. Otherwise, if you don&amp;#39;t mind the slow service, extreme lack of attentiveness, rude/uncomfortable wait staff, questionable lack of bread, and long periods of wait time, this place is just fine. Just don&amp;#39;t expect your drinks to be refilled. Ever.

The only good thing I can say about the entire experience is the hostess and the bartender on staff. The bartender was very attentive, offered drink suggestions, and really was enthusiastic about our celebration. When we were seated at a booth was when things went from good to worse! After 25 minutes+, our server came over to take drink/appetizer orders, we weren&amp;#39;t quite ready to order but had informed the server that he could bring us bread and butter, and that we were celebrating my dad&amp;#39;s birthday. His demeanor was short, impatient, inattentive, and unpleasant - as he never acknowledged or even said Happy Birthday to my father and rather dismissed it and reconfirmed the water/bread order. \u00a0His dismissive response resulted in us requesting a different server, which in return, we were asked to move to a different table to be accommodated.<br&gt;<br&gt;Upon moving to the &amp;#34;next&amp;#34; table, it took another 30 minutes to be acknowledged. Once the server came to deliver waters, my father (the birthday guy) said that he was happy to finally see someone as we were ready to order. The server, in response, said that the reason that our service was delayed because we were switching &amp;#34;back and forth between tables&amp;#34;. Once our party observed the \u00a0same dismissive treatment as the first waiter, we told him that they were making an uncomfortable and unpleasant experience for my dad&amp;#39;s birthday. Instead of apologizing and trying to better the experience, he delivered waters and also never acknowledged the birthday, Once Again! Then the manager comes to the table with bread minutes later and has yet the SAME DISMISSIVE attitude. Once we addressed our issues and told him that service was no longer required, due to the lack of appreciation of our business and attentiveness, he was a replica of the culture of the poor service. Not once did he apologize for our unfortunate/discomfort with the first 2 servers, he instead welcomed the idea of us patronizing another establishment instead. <br&gt;<br&gt;We left displeased, unhappy, and highly disappointed as we frequented this location throughout the past, and service on a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; day (opposed to a birthday celebration) was NEVER as bad! <br&gt;<br&gt;Luckily upon leaving, we went to the Signature Room and were treated with Great Service and Appreciation of us choosing them to help celebrate such a significant milestone.

Honestly! \u00a0Just print them up and insert them in the front of this massive book they call a menu. \u00a0I believe less is more and the menu here wants to make everyone happy and in the end it makes no one happy! \u00a0And the evidence is in the lossy food they push out of the kitchen.<br&gt;<br&gt;On my most recent visit I asked the hostess to have a booth because this was going to be a working lunch and we needed some room to layout our documents and make notes. \u00a0She took me to a table that had benches...I asked her if she considered it a booth and she said yes. \u00a0I then informed her that my colleague was not going to be happy but she insisted it was a booth. \u00a0So we sat down and literally our chest were at the table height. \u00a0There was no way we could even write or take notes. I hate to say I told you so but I am going to say, &amp;#34;I TOLD YOU SO!&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;So we got up and asked her again if we could have a booth. \u00a0It was already after 1pm and we had missed the lunch crowd, so there were plenty of booths in the back. \u00a0She then took us to a booth that had been half cleaned but not on my side. \u00a0I grabbed a clean napkin from another table and picked up the dirty tray and moved it to the next table. I then used the napkin to wipe up the mess. \u00a0It was awkward with me just standing in the aisle and I was not about to sit on top of a mess.<br&gt;<br&gt;The bus boy arrived and started to clean our whole table again. \u00a0He then grabbed his dirty gross full of wet food tray. Next he took silverware from the table that the dirty gross full of wet food tray was sitting on top of and placed it all in front of me. \u00a0Honestly I was so grossed out. \u00a0Someone call the health department! \u00a0How oblivious could this guy be? \u00a0This is just bad management and a corporation that does not care about keeping things clean for their customers. \u00a0I got up again and went to a different table to get myself some fresh silverware, a new plate and a clean napkin. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered our food and made a few simple requests. \u00a0For example, I ordered my turkey sandwich to have mayo on the side. \u00a0Guess what? \u00a0I got mayo on the side and also got mayo on the sandwich. \u00a0Really? \u00a0Again the kitchen did not care enough to read the notes of the waiter. \u00a0I did not send it back because we were having a business meeting and I just needed to keep working and eating at the same time. \u00a0I also got my salad dressing on the side too and it never came to the table. \u00a0I had to remind the food runner about it and eventually the waiter brought it.<br&gt;<br&gt;My buddy got the fish tacos and when I asked him how they were he made a face that told me they were not really good. \u00a0I am so glad we did not share them because I would have been mad. \u00a0He then said, &amp;#34;I do not even like this place it is just so close to the office!&amp;#34; \u00a0Not to self...find a new restaurant to have our lunch meetings in!<br&gt;<br&gt;So yes this place is a tourist trap. \u00a0It is one of those chains that all of the hungry shoppers on Michigan Avenue from out of town end up in because it is familiar to them. \u00a0Now do not get me wrong there cheesecake is good and maybe cheesecake on this visit would have made me feel better or even 4 star-ish but cheesecake and business lunches do not go together.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food here is not that great. \u00a0In all of the years I have still not found anything on this menu that just jumps out and says, &amp;#34;Order me all of the time!&amp;#34; \u00a0In fact, I just give up! \u00a0This place is a cheesecake place that happens to serve bad food too. \u00a0And when I say bad food...I mean food that is not even special or good. \u00a0I was also not happy with the service. \u00a0A hostess who could not actually give us a booth even though there were a bunch available. \u00a0A busboy who really did not care if his dirty disgusting tray was touching clean silverware and plates. \u00a0Someone could get sick because of this. \u00a0Food that had special requests made but none of the special requests were even carried out correctly. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;This place just keeps packing people in and does not care to make it the best experience ever! \u00a0And that is sad with all of the amazing restaurants in downtown Chicago. \u00a0I wish you would clean up your act cheesecake factory and have a little respect for the product you are serving the public.", "rating": 1, "date": "11/16/2012"}, {"text": "The good the bad and the ugly:<br&gt;<br&gt;The GAUDIEST restaurant I&amp;#39;ve ever seen personally. <br&gt;My dirty silverware, just so off putting<br&gt;A nice, but no name server as an &amp;#34;order taker&amp;#34;<br&gt;No saucer OR spoon for my dbl espresso, not happy.<br&gt; <br&gt;This pizza is pretty &amp;#34;picture perfect&amp;#34;<br&gt;Avocado club screams yummy value<br&gt;<br&gt;Tiramisu was stellar, yet the beauty of a classic dessert from Italy was taken away with a half a pound of whipped cream they put on the desert- there&amp;#39;s literally more whipped cream and than there was desert, very sad.", "rating": 2, "date": "2/19/2015"}, {"text": "It&amp;#39;s been a while since I have been to any Cheesecake Factory.

We&amp;#39;re now past an hour after ordering, about 20 minutes later part 2 of order arrives, I approach manager and ask if he&amp;#39;s aware of the huge backlog, he assures me my order is ready to go, then I remind him that half of my order has been sitting on the counter for about 20 minutes and my hotel room is not equipped with a microwave. He offers a slice of cheesecake to ease the pain, I tell him cheesecake is no match for the bitching and moaning I&amp;#39;ll get when I show up to the hotel room an hour later than expected with cold food. I am if he thinks they can re-do the order, he looks at me like I&amp;#39;m out of my mind, but obliges. Text my wife to let her know what&amp;#39;s going on, she informs me both kids have fallen asleep. I track down the manager to let him know it doesn&amp;#39;t look like it&amp;#39;s meant to be, he&amp;#39;s sincere with his apologies and refunds my credit card.

They have arguably the &amp;#34;Worst Dish In America&amp;#34; with their Bistro Shrimp pasta, clocking in at over 2200 calories per serving. That&amp;#39;s more than a days worth of calories in one gloppy plate of pasta! Que horreur! But, it was either beg off dinner or join the group. So I joined the group.<br&gt;<br&gt;Kudo&amp;#39;s on the Skinnylicious Menu. They have a number of selections advertised as less than 590 calories, so I guess that is acceptable. Mostly these selections are salads or fish (or a combination of both). <br&gt;<br&gt;I had the chopped salad, which contained chicken, apple, corn and avocado and it was pretty good. I didn&amp;#39;t trust the calorie count so I didn&amp;#39;t finish it.<br&gt;<br&gt;My seatmate to the right had the grilled ahi tuna salad, which he was very pleased with. He literally ate every last morsel of salad on the plate. I personally don&amp;#39;t like raw tuna, but he really found the meal excellent. His wife ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and again, she said she really enjoyed it. I was told that she never likes anything she gets at a restaurant, so this was really a victory for The Cheesecake Factory. <br&gt;<br&gt;One of my table mates had the appetizer chicken Caesar salad, and it was enormous. We all said, &amp;#34;This is the appetizer size???&amp;#34; Honestly, it was entree sized. But good, reportedly. <br&gt;<br&gt;There were other, acceptable dishes on the table, none so good that they warrant inclusion in this review. The only other thing to note was the size of the desserts. Again, one slice of cheesecake was as big as the entree. Ginormous. And the very slender woman who ordered it dispatched it down her alimentary canal with alacrity. I don&amp;#39;t know how a very slender woman can eat 3000 calories worth of food and stay slender.<br&gt;<br&gt;So all in all, I would have to say that the Cheesecake Factory wasn&amp;#39;t bad.

The lady said it was a half hour wait and kindly informed me that I could not put my name on the list over the phone when I tried to. My boyfriend ended up arriving before me, so our table was ready by the time I got there. I asked him how long he had been there and he said it had only been a 15 minute wait. <br&gt;<br&gt;We were escorted to our table and given menus. I have seen some pretty large &amp;#39;multi-paged&amp;#39; menus in my lifetime, but never had I seen a menu with ads! I chuckled to myself as it became clear why this place was labeled a tourist trap. As we were perusing, a female server named Liz came over and introduced herself. She asked if she could start us off with drinks and I asked her for two ice waters and two cups of hot water. [The hot water was for the silverware, which several Yelpers had pointed out would be filthy and to my suprise, were correct.] A few minutes after she left, a male server named Ryan came over and introduced himself. He then proceeded to ask if he could get us any drinks. Suprised, I told him we had been greeted already. He then explained that the previous server had been confused about whether or not we were her table, and apologized for the confusion.<br&gt;<br&gt;After recieving our drinks, being served warm bread and Ryan patiently answering all of my boyfriend&amp;#39;s redundant questions about salads, we ordered our entrees. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio while my boyfriend ended up going with the Ceasar. Our food arrived in a timely manner, long enough for me to discover that each bathroom stall has its own personal sink and us to eat all of our bread, and looked absolutely delicious. Once we began to dig in, we both were pleasantly suprised. His Ceasar was generously portioned and well-dressed, while my pasta had my tastebuds rejoicing. I begged him to taste my dish and he, being born in Italy and a Italian food connoisseur, was also impressed.<br&gt;<br&gt;The overall evening was better than I expected, and my complaints were few and far apart. Sadly, it was my night to pick up the bill and last night&amp;#39;s budget did not allow for me to try an cheesecake. Lol.

(I miss you, Avery!)<br&gt;With all of that being said, I went again tonight. I told myself that it was for the Pre-National Cheesecake Day deal (1/2 off dessert slices), but I digress. I am taking the time to be the bazillionth reviewer of The Cheesecake Factory because of water! Yes, you read me correctly. Water is the the reason for this review. I just couldn&amp;#39;t take it anymore! The food, the ambience, and the service are all laudable, but the water SUCKS DIRT! I don&amp;#39;t understand how a fine dining establishment such as TCF can serve its guests such AWFUL water! I had to squeeze almost an entire lime into my glass in order to make it palatable! About 3 visits prior, I went with a very outspoken friend, who, upon being asked by our server if he needed anything else, said,&amp;#34;Yes. Get rid of this nasty a** water, and bring me some GOOD water! I was a mortified, but the server returned shortly with a glass of perfectly delicious, and, apparently, purified water! He mentioned that he&amp;#39;d gotten it from another part of the restaurant. Hunh?!?<br&gt;You KNOW what I asked for on my next visit, right? Unfortunately, this server must not have known about the secret source, because he brought me a bottle of Fiji and a glass, and tacked on a hefty $5 for the pleasure. It&amp;#39;s needless to say that I didn&amp;#39;t try that one again, as I don&amp;#39;t particularly care to pay so dearly for a glass of water worth drinking.<br&gt;<br&gt;My dearest Cheesecake Factory, can you PLEASE remedy this one major flaw? I would greatly appreciate it, but I won&amp;#39;t bother to make empty threats, because I&amp;#39;ll be back tomorrow to celebrate National Cheesecake Day properly!", "rating": 4, "date": "7/30/2013"}, {"text": "Staff is insanely rude and the food is mediocre and overpriced.

You would think that since it took that long that maybe they were still preparing and cooking it? Hahahahha, another joke. Everything was cold. One of the burgers, supposed to be cooked medium well, was completely black and charred on the outside and was raw in the middle. The kids pizza looked like it had been sitting out for hours. The milkshake was straight up just milk. Even the soda tasted like a poor imitation of sparkling water. The avocado rolls were all dark brown. What kills me is the cashier took our money and let us just stand there for over 40 minutes waiting for food that if I had known the quality, wouldn&amp;#39;t even deserve $10. Even getting to talk to someone is a waste. I called shortly after arriving back home to speak with a manager about the predicament. I was put on hold for over twenty minutes before I just hung up. New management, new employees, new plan altogether needs to be initiated immediately. This location is particularly lucky that most of the customers are tourists visiting the city of Chicago because of would be surprised to find out that this location has loyal customers.

I would recommend you the Cheesecake factory, as it includes all of those options.<br&gt;<br&gt;To begin with, I want to highlight a wide range of dishes and their unusual big portions. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Cheesecake Factory has his own extraordinary atmosphere. It creates a special mood among guests. I was really impressed by a unique d\u00e9cor, which makes you feel like you are in a fairytale: the nicely subdued light, pleasant music playing on the background, white-dressed waiters. <br&gt;It is very clear from these observations that the Cheesecake Factory has all options to serve guests best and exceed their expectations. If you are interested in high service, appetizing food, unusual and out-of-the way atmosphere, so the Cheesecake Factory is a great alternative for you.<br&gt;<br&gt;When I came to the Cheesecake Factory, I liked immediately the service of this place. The stuff find to you a table and they present a menu. Before to take the order, they bring to you a glass of water and than I ordered pasta. A big plate of pasta Fettuccine Alfredo, that could be divided among 3 persons, surprised me. It is a common fact that the bigger the size of portions the bigger the price. The Cheesecake Factory is an exception to this rule. In addition, the dishes are not just large they are extremely tasty. It is an indisputable advantage that makes consumers happy. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Cheesecake Factory has the most various and delicious range of cheesecake flavors such as: Oreo, Pumpkin, Red Velvet Cake and so on. I ordered the Strawberry cheesecake, which was so delicious and looked really beautiful.

I always go to a CF for my birthday since cheesecake is THE best dessert and their selection is amazing. Yesterday was my birthday and I was craving some orange chicken (which is what I always tend to order) and birthday cheesecake. So, my husband and I headed over for some birthday fun (or so I thought). <br&gt;<br&gt;The location is great which is also why I wanted to go, the view and the breeze while sitting outside are amazing! It was a Monday night and was surprisingly busy (tourists maybe?), so we waited about 30 minutes for a table outside, which was fine, I don&amp;#39;t mind waiting so long as the experience is a good one. Once we sat down, a waiter did not come by to take our order for about 15min. We already knew what we wanted to order since we had decided during our 30min wait. When the waiter came by, FINALLY, we ordered our food (spinach and cheese dip as an appetizer, orange chicken for me and pasta carbonara for my husband). Our waiter asked if we wanted some bread, we of course said YES! The bread took about another 15min to arrive, and by then our appetizer arrived too. Ok, so far so good. Then, about 20min later, our food arrived. We were about ready to eat a whale at that point, we were super hungry!<br&gt;<br&gt;That&amp;#39;s when the disappointment comes. The food was bland. The white rice that came with my orange chicken was cold, the orange chicken itself was also cold and hard, not nice and chewy and flavorful like I remember. My husband&amp;#39;s pasta was watery and was cold as well, no salt, no flavor. We tried to make the best of it and tried to eat it as is, but stopped about 1/4 of the way through and just could not take another bite. We were waiting for the server to come by to tell him, but he didn&amp;#39;t come by for another 30min. By then, we just wanted to go home. I told him that the food was horrible and we just wanted the check. He said that we should&amp;#39;ve told him earlier so that he could&amp;#39;ve told his manager and the cooks and given us other options. (Um, maybe if you didn&amp;#39;t take 30min to check on us?) But, apparently we had eaten some of it and we no longer would be credible. WHAT? We ate 1/4 of the plate because we attempted to deal with it. If it were good, trust me, the plates would have been CLEAN, no food left on them. My husband and I are huge foodies. <br&gt;<br&gt;I heard the waiter talk to his manager behind us, trying to get us a discount I guess (nice of him), but his manager just shrugged his shoulders and we were given our $70 bill for the appetizer we ate and 1/4 portion we could stomach down. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK TO CF. I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s just this location because it&amp;#39;s downtown, but it really put a dent in my loyalty to CF.

All foam. Top to bottom. Guy just left it there. Server came by and said they had to switch the tap so I said, &amp;#34;Sure, as long as I can get a new beer and not the one sitting there.&amp;#34; He agreed and eventually I got my beer. But, the issue was, the bartender decided to just ADD to my foam that had been sitting there as foam slowly turning into beer for 15 minutes. The beer was rather warm and nasty. Server came back, I asked for a new beer, and received new beer somewhat correct (the bottled beer was WAY colder than the draft beer). By then it was after my apps came out that I finally received my beer. It was 20 minutes to receive a beer. It was also very weird that when I went to tell my server about the beer all I had to do was say &amp;#34;excuse me&amp;#34; and he goes, &amp;#34;Is your beer warm?&amp;#34; like he already knew....<br&gt;<br&gt;For dinner, I ordered the Chicken Tacos. They brought out shrimp then came back with the correct ones after saying that I ordered chicken. Bit into the tacos and started to wonder why they tasted funny. Turns out the taco shells were stale! Told the server, and the poor guy just can see it and feel it.... the look on his face. Thankfully he comped the tacos because by then, I really did not want to eat there.<br&gt;<br&gt;The people were nice but it is rather clear there is something wrong with their managers (a bartender who can&amp;#39;t pour beer and a kitchen that can&amp;#39;t keep taco shells fresh). <br&gt;<br&gt;I say go anywhere -except- there.<br&gt;<br&gt;TL;DR: Ordered beer, got warm foam-beer.

This review is for the downtown location which I visited this past week. We grabbed lunch around 12 o&amp;#39;clock so we waited a tad few. No biggie. Mind you I could see that the restaurant wasn&amp;#39;t at full capacity, but I digress. Our server seemed very heavy footed and I could feel him reading me like a book. As if he somehow knew these two Mexicans weren&amp;#39;t going to tip him the appropriate amount compared to his more sophisticated white tables. Turns out he was just a flat out horrid server. He did these super long pauses between dropping off drinks, bread, appetizers and taking our lunch order. Last time I was here the waitress was so helpful. She told us about the soup of the day the specials and even recommended her favorite dishes. So friendly and attentive. Total opposite from my most current experience. \u00a0He didn&amp;#39;t tell us anything but the soup of the day. He said the sod was clam chowder and that it was the only soup available in a very harsh monotone. As if saying we better not even think about wanting something different or else. Yikes. We started off with stuffed mushrooms and the crab bites. This day the mushrooms had a funny taste, sort of like old mushrooms. They didn&amp;#39;t taste fresh which it why I usually order them. The crab bites are always delightful. Very crispy on the outside but moist on the inside. <br&gt;When dinning at The Cheesecake Factory I usually get the pasta carbonara. The sauce in the pasta is very delicious. Very very calorie filled but very delicious in deed. Peas and bacon, How can you go wrong? \u00a0I decided to try something new. The Shepard pot pie screamed my name. Mushrooms, carrots, squash, ground beef, mash potatoes , yum! The dish was very savory. I really wish it had some sort of pastry crust. That would of definitely brought the dish together. \u00a0I forgot what my bf had. He liked it. Something Cajun maybe I can&amp;#39;t remember. Ha. <br&gt;To quickly sum my experience up I had a nice lunch for the exception of our server. I only saw him hovering over us when he wanted us to pay the bill. Made me not want to return to that location in particular. But who am I kidding. I just won&amp;#39;t sit in his section. If only I remember our waitress name :(( <br&gt;<br&gt;Ps.

He did not know what he had coming to him. When we walked in, the Hostess smiled and told us that it was going to be a 45-60 minute wait. She told us we can go over to the bar area and wait. I told my friend it was worth the wait and in the meantime were going to have a drink to kill time. I ordered a Georgia Peach for him and me. It is Skyy Vodka, Peach Liqueur, peaches and raspberries blended with ice. It is so refreshing that you want more. \u00a0After 45 minutes of waiting our name was called, just like the Hostess promise. <br&gt;Next, the waitress gave us our menus. The menu has over 200 food selections to choose from that can make the decision process a little challenging, because you are going to want everything. Like always, I chose the Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad. \u00a0After 20 minutes of waiting my food was delivered with the best presentation. It came on a big plate with a portion size big enough for two in the shape of a pyramid. The salad is tossed in a BBQ Ranch Dressing topped with corn, tomatoes, cucumbers, black beans and fried onion strings. The salad also comes with avocado but I opted to have them keep it. The chicken is served hot and it was very delicious. This salad is awesome and is highly recommended. <br&gt;In addition to that the atmosphere was great. The place is family friendly oriented and a good place for a date. It is nicely decorated with brown and tan paint. It also has gold trimmings around the ceilings. Also there is music playing while you are eating. However due to the capacity of the restaurant you may not hear it. The front of the restaurant is very clean and smells great. The bathroom is just as clean as the front of the house. <br&gt;Furthermore the service is exceptional. All the way from the Hostess, the bartender, the waitress, and the bussers. They make sure that you are taking care of and you don&amp;#39;t have to ask for more. The waitress always kept our water glasses filled and the Georgia Peach&amp;#39;s arrive at a reasonable time. It occurred to me that she had a system to her service skills. The restaurant was very busy and she had other tables but she seemed to make us feel like we were her only customers. <br&gt;At the end of it all the waitress asked us if we wanted desert.

So here starts the crisis: the waitress comes by three more times to say the bread will &amp;#34;be right out if the oven.&amp;#34; She then goes on to say how the whole wheat bread is delicious and it&amp;#39;s so good but she&amp;#39;s still waiting for it to come out. Seriously what the fuck? You don&amp;#39;t tell a table of hungry people that the bread is delicious but sorry you don&amp;#39;t have any yet. I could really give two rat asses about the bread but it was built up so much, I wanted some.<br&gt;<br&gt;So we were figuring the entrees would arrive before the bread, which they did. And the fresh baked bread? Cold. But wait, I thought it was right out of the oven? My entrees wasn&amp;#39;t any better. When I go to CF I usually get the Baja chicken tacos because they&amp;#39;re consistently yummy. These tacos were so bland, it wasn&amp;#39;t funny. The portions were huge but had no flavor. Such a disappointment because the entree is really delicious when made right. The beans and rice were the highlight of the dish and that was sad.<br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, the service sucked, the place was about 500 degrees and the tables were so close together.

If you have a strong loyalty to the Cheesecake Factory, perhaps you should go read something else. Just a thought. <br&gt;<br&gt;I remember the first time I went to a Cheesecake Factory -- it was in Jersey, in a mall. Even as a surly 13 year old with the palate sophistication of an alley cat, I was entirely underwhelmed. There was no sense of being momentarily welcomed into a respite from the world, like you experience at truly good restaurants at any price range. There was a weird taste coating my mouth when we finished. <br&gt;<br&gt;This uneasy feeling -- as if I&amp;#39;m dining on a movie set and everything looks real, but isn&amp;#39;t -- has only grown with the numerous work-sponsored &amp;#34;team bonding&amp;#34; lunches at CF&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;ve had to endure over the years. The conclusion I&amp;#39;ve come to is that, like so many other restaurants, CF is pure mediocrity and it simply exhausts me. <br&gt;<br&gt;CF should accept the fact that it is on par with an Applebee&amp;#39;s or Friendly&amp;#39;s. At least those places don&amp;#39;t attempt to be anything they&amp;#39;re not! The food is no better and neither is the service. And at CF, you have to try to stomach that Wal-Martized version of fine dining decor. <br&gt;<br&gt;Larger portions do not = better quality. Really. The price might be right, but those massive piles of cardboard doused in fat and sugar are all that is wrong with America. <br&gt;<br&gt;Why on EARTH would you want to eat somewhere called a &amp;#34;factory&amp;#34;? Go out and pick up Pollan&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;Omnivore&amp;#39;s Dilemma.&amp;#34; Try and tell me, after reading it, that you want to put something that ADMITS to being straight from a factory in your mouth! (Even if you&amp;#39;re not going to tell me anything of the sort, read the book anyway.)<br&gt;<br&gt;As I write this, I realize that many will wonder why I care. &amp;#34;If you don&amp;#39;t like it, don&amp;#39;t go there!&amp;#34; (You were thinking that. I know.) And you have a point. However, I think what I&amp;#39;m really railing against here is the sense that people don&amp;#39;t demand better food, atmosphere, service. No one thinks twice about spending their money on something perhaps temporarily tasty but ultimately insubstantial, and that&amp;#39;s why these places exist. These mediocre restaurants keep popping up like mushrooms, and eventually people start to think its the norm. <br&gt;<br&gt;For the price of a CF meal, you can easily feast somewhere more genuine, if you&amp;#39;re willing to look. So, no, I won&amp;#39;t go to CF anymore. I&amp;#39;ll skip the office birthday and &amp;#34;so sorry you&amp;#39;re leaving us&amp;#34; celebrations.

My mother ordered a Mai Thai which was perfect , mines tasted like a completely different drink. \u00a0I requested that it be remade, I am assuming the bartender finally put a little passion and focus into the drink, because the third drink was great. \u00a0I typically order the chicken madeira but decided match it up (Factory Combination) with the shrimp scampi. My mother ordered the Southern fried catfish, which was overcooked. My chicken maderia was prefect as usual, however the shrimp scampi was not freshly made. It was obviously prep and left to sit, the shrimp texture was soggy and room temperature. \u00a0I am really disappointed \u00a0in the lack of attention that went into the food and drinks.

By the way, the menu is incredibly long. Most of the items there are 2000+ calories, but if you are not one to diet occasionally, you have nothing to worry about. My choices were limited to fish and salads.<br&gt;<br&gt;We did not have dessert, so I cannot comment on the highly complimented cheesecake.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I wouldn&amp;#39;t visit this location again, nor would I visit Cheesecake Factory.

However, I found the food to be less than impressive.<br&gt;First of all, I ordered the orange chicken. It was good, but it wasn&amp;#39;t great. The portion was huge. Two people could have been fully satisfied with the amount of food on that plate. If I lived in Chicago, the large portion would be worth it. But this is the Cheesecake Factory.

So I got a simple traditional cheesecake with strawberries and whipped cream. Again, it was good, but it was not amazing.<br&gt;What was amazing was the peach bellini, which is why I ordered a second. Our tables&amp;#39; second round of bellinis had something a bit crunchy in them. It was glass! Apparently some glass got into the ice and all of our drinks were made in the same blender, so we all drank some glass with our dinner.<br&gt;The manager was very apologetic, and they did offer us free dessert to make up for it. <br&gt;I&amp;#39;m not taking away any stars for this incident because it was just an accident, and I was impressed with the way the manager handled the situation. I just didn&amp;#39;t think the restaurant lived up to the hype. I also felt the portions were oversized to compensate for overpricing. Also, the wait is long, but on a happier note the service was efficient and friendly.<br&gt;Also, if you are a dessert fan but not necessarily a cheesecake person, I would recommend the Lemoncello Cream Torte.

As patrons further enter The Cheesecake Factory, the lighting of the establishment is engulfed by low lit tungsten fluorescent, thus enhancing the cavernous design of the walls. \u00a0Patrons may find the interior to possess a subtle claustrophobic and blinding feel. \u00a0What&amp;#39;s also daunting, but slightly attractive (with respects to the design), is the echoing capacity of the facility. \u00a0Given the excess of 300 patrons that dine during any given second at this establishment, the echoing roar of sporadic conversation increases the decibels levels of the establishment.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Food:<br&gt;<br&gt;Entree - Energy Breakfast: \u00a0The &amp;#34;Energy Breakfast&amp;#34; consists of 3 Scrambled Egg Whites that&amp;#39;s served with 3 oz. of Grilled Chicken Breast, Sliced Tomato, and Sauteed Mushroom &amp;amp;amp; Spinach. \u00a0At first glance, the first visually disturbing site, with respects to the execution of this dish, is the rendering of water from the cooked spinach. \u00a0The bottom of the plate was littered with the liquid excess. \u00a0This aided in the diluting of the simple seasoning used in the preparation of this application. \u00a0Upon consumption, the Egg Whites contained a supremely coarse texture, thus indicating overcooking. \u00a0The Chicken Breasts were excessively overcooked and under seasoned, with the texture of the chicken to be coarse. \u00a0The sliced tomatoes were the victims of the excess liquid flow as they become mushy and inedible. \u00a0The ultimate welcoming aspect of the dish was the sauteed spinach &amp;amp;amp; mushrooms. \u00a0Both were cooked perfectly and contained the earthiness found in both ingredients.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Dessert:<br&gt;<br&gt;Strawberry Cheesecake: At first reception, the excessive portion size of the Cheesecake spoke wonders to the receiving eye. \u00a0Patrons will notice that the 10 oz. to 12 oz. serving size of the Cheesecake will force any patron to seek a take out box. \u00a0Luckily, the excessive offerings produced a welcoming satiety to those seeking gluttonous punishment. \u00a0During visual inspection, the Cheesecake was observed to have the proper white color that&amp;#39;s accompanied by an elegant soft texture. \u00a0The graham cracker crust, acting as the base of the foundation, contained a semi-firm texture. \u00a0Finally, the Fresh Strawberries and syrup produced an excellent color contrast to the application. \u00a0At first bite, patrons will find that the primary taste observed is from the light, velvety, and fluffy cheesecake. \u00a0During consumption, the creamy texture of the application engulfs the palate by releasing the notable cream cheese flavors. \u00a0Further tasting will reveal notes of vanilla, brown sugar, and butter, which enhance the creaminess of the cheese by providing a subtle sweetness. \u00a0All ingredients used in the creation of the cheesecake work harmoniously to create both an abundance of flavors while keeping the subtle soft texture of the cake. \u00a0To aid in the textural contrast, the semi-crunchy graham cracker crust provided the scrumptious texture and cinnamon flavors to further enhance the cheesecake. \u00a0Although the Strawberries provided the round about freshness and earthiness to the application, it acted secondary to the palate consuming flavors of the cheesecake.<br&gt;<br&gt;Perhaps perfection is observed through The Cheesecake Factory&amp;#39;s rendition of Cheesecake. \u00a0By creating an edible that embodies the palate clasping flavors of the ingredients used while keeping the integrity and structure of the creaminess of the cheese, the application stands above the rest in both the complexity and tasting of this application. \u00a0Few remarkable words can be noted regarding the superb execution of the cheesecake, but the ones rendered should be emphasized for it&amp;#39;s extraordinary flavors and execution.<br&gt;<br&gt;Notes on Cheesecake Factory:<br&gt;<br&gt;1) Cheesecake = $6.00 to $7.00, but well worth it.<br&gt;2) Avoid the long wait... \u00a0Simply get the Cheesecake to go.<br&gt;3) Avoid the food! \u00a0A lot of my party felt the food was lack and the star is the Cheesecake.<br&gt;4) Service was chaotic due to the increased customer to wait staff ratio.<br&gt;5) Seriously... \u00a0Just go for the Cheesecake!", "rating": 4, "date": "6/25/2009"}, {"text": "Customer service blew hardcore.

Out of the three of us who went, neither of us had tried the cheesecake factory, so we thought we should see what the big deal is. The wait was 40 minutes, but I expected that, especially from a chain restaurant. I had a gut feeling this would be a bad experience from how noisy it was, not to mention we were seated right by the kitchen where they drop dishes every minute. We waited about 10 minutes for the waiter to come by and take our orders for drinks. He takes another 10 minutes bringing our drinks. <br&gt;<br&gt;This is where it all falls apart. I ordered the meatloaf (don&amp;#39;t ask), the birthday girl orders shrimp pasta, and my friend orders a grilled cheese. So after he takes our orders he tells us he would bring us bread, about 10 minutes go by and no bread. We had to pull him out of his way to ask him for the bread and refills, then he says &amp;#34;Oh, You wanted bread?!&amp;#34;. We just sat there looking at each other like &amp;#34;REALLY?!&amp;#34;.. So eventually brings us some damn bread, but no refills. Then my friend&amp;#39;s pasta finally comes, while me and my other friend are still waiting for our food. They told us our food would be ready in just a couple of minutes about 3 times, like I really believed that bullshit. They FINALLY bring out my friend&amp;#39;s grilled cheese (We were waiting for about an hour and a half since we ordered) how long does it even take to make a GRILLED CHEESE? Seriously??!!! So they have their food and I still don&amp;#39;t have mine, and neither of us have our refills!! <br&gt;<br&gt;As I was waiting for my food (still), my friend is dissatisfied with her pasta, so she, in all honesty, puts a hair in her pasta and tells the manager. Yes, we cheated them, but we waited two hours and got the shittiest service you can imagine. So she asks for soup instead of another entree. She gets her soup, but with NO SPOON. She was left eating the bacon bits with her knife, because they also didn&amp;#39;t bring her another fork. Meanwhile I still don&amp;#39;t have my fucking meatloaf. About 15 minutes passes by and the bring me a sub-par meatloaf. I only took two bites of my meatloaf when, upon further inspection, I find a ACUTUAL hair. It wasn&amp;#39;t mine, because I have long hair; this was about half the size of mine. I was disgusted. Karma is a bitch. My friend complains to the manager about the crap service and the shitty food, to which he tells us that it&amp;#39;s no excuse and offers us a free cheesecake slice and a happy birthday song. Honestly we felt so offended by that, it was basically a slap to the face. We did not want to spend another minute there, we had half the mind to leave. Just as we put on our coats, our waiter (who we only saw 3 times) comes by and tells us its on them. DAMN STRAIGHT IT&amp;#39;S ON THEM, I wasn&amp;#39;t going to pay for any of that! We storm out of there, and as we are leaving, the manager tells us how this isn&amp;#39;t their standards and blah, blah, blah, bullshit. But we just blew him off and ignored him. <br&gt;<br&gt;It was seriously THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER. I was honestly waiting for someone to give me $100 for being on MTV&amp;#39;s boiling points, it was THAT BAD. Not even kidding, I was looking for hidden cameras. It was surreal; how could a restaurant give service like THAT?! Especially for a restaurant downtown?! Especially for someone&amp;#39;s birthday?! And the excuses they gave us? HA! Like I really believed them, they were so ridiculous. But for some reason, when we past the revolving doors to leave, we busted out laughing. It was just one big joke, and has since then become the butt of all our jokes. <br&gt;<br&gt;And if we learned anything, it&amp;#39;s that; <br&gt;1. bring a spoon<br&gt;2. never order the meatloaf<br&gt;3. only go for the cheese cake, I guess..<br&gt;4. chain restaurants really are the devil (and are made for tourists)<br&gt;<br&gt;But hey, at least the food was free.....", "rating": 1, "date": "1/2/2011"}, {"text": "This place is a dieters and penny pinchers enemy.

The food is reliably okay, anywhere in the country. I do, however, love their new small plates menu. Thus our epic begins.<br&gt;<br&gt;The first time I visited this location, they didn&amp;#39;t even give us a copy of the small plates menu. They just gave us the regular one. Since we were all tired and hungry, this led to a lot of whining and being pissy because we thought we&amp;#39;d come out for no reason. The server didn&amp;#39;t do anything to remedy that, either. After finally settling on some regular food to order, we were told that the artichokes in the kitchen were no good and so I would have to order something else. Shouldn&amp;#39;t the servers be told that before the dinner rush? Anyway, my food finally came and it wasn&amp;#39;t great but it was passable. My companion spilled her drink and a manager who came to check on us told her he&amp;#39;d be right back to clean it up for us but never returned so she sat with a lap and table full of ice water for her whole meal. At the end of the meal we spoke to another manager who then discounted the enter meal save for the cost of drinks and we were pretty much satisfied with the kind and professional way he handled the situation. <br&gt;<br&gt;Last week we returned and &amp;#39;lo and behold, the small plates menu had been added to the main menu, avoiding any future confusion. Thank you, Cheesecake Factory! We ordered our meal and in the process of bringing things out, our server dropped both of my roommates&amp;#39; items. The food, when it came out, was tasty and I enjoyed it all (stuffed mushrooms, beet salad, garlic knots, a perfect assortment). Then the server got kind of creepy and starting trying to talk to us about the death of John Coltrane and asking my barely 20 year old roommate about her interests (he was closer to late 30s/early 40s) in a way that made us uncomfortable.<br&gt;<br&gt;So, I guess it&amp;#39;s up in the air.
