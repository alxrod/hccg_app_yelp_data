Their food is always great, and this time was no different. Came here on Saturday 10.19.19 before heading to see Maleficent at Cinemark Towson. They don&amp;#39;t do reservations or call ahead seating here, which is a bit of a gamble coming here on a Saturday so we decided to give ourselves plenty of time (or so we thought). Our movie started at 8:30 and we had reserved seats, so we weren&amp;#39;t terribly worried about getting there exactly at 8:30. We arrived to the Cheesecake Factory around 6:30. I figured we&amp;#39;d probably have a half hour to 45 minute wait, so I was assuming we&amp;#39;d be sitting by 7:15 and hopefully done eating by 8:15. Well I was spot on with the 7:15 part but our server didn&amp;#39;t come to greet us and take our drink order until almost 7:30. And he passed by our table several times beforehand. When he came to take our drink order, we were already ready to put in our food order since we were a little pressed for time; however, before we could say &amp;#34;we are ready to order,&amp;#34; he walked away to get our drinks. And he didn&amp;#39;t come back with them (fountain drinks, not cocktails) for another 5 or so minutes. When he came back with the drinks we told him we were ready to order. We got stuffed mushrooms to share, and I got ribeye medium rare and my partner got a chicken Cesar salad. Our server went to get us bread and yet again was gone for 5-10 minutes. Our food didn&amp;#39;t come until around 8:00 so we had to rush to eat. Unfortunately it wasn&amp;#39;t our server who delivered the food so we had to wait to see him again to ask for the check while we were still eating, so we could just get out of there. When we finally saw him again, we asked for our check. He came back with it after another 5 minutes, I gave him a gift card to pay, and then when he came back with the receipt we asked for a box for the salad. Then a large party of maybe 10 got seated right next to us, and instead of getting our box he proceeds to immediately take their orders as soon as they sat down. We had to flag down a hostess for a box for our leftovers. <br&gt;<br&gt;I get it, Saturday&amp;#39;s are busy here and so we tried to plan accordingly. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s unreasonable to expect to not have to rush for an 8:30 movie when you get to the restaurant 2 hours before the movies start time. But we didn&amp;#39;t end up leaving the Cheesecake Factory until around 8:25 after arriving at 6:30. For 2 people. Thank goodness for reserved seating at the movies. <br&gt;<br&gt;I will say that my ribeye was one of the best I&amp;#39;ve ever eaten and I tried my partner&amp;#39;s chicken Cesar salad which was also delicious.

Upon entering the restaurant I had hoped to be assisted by one of this establishment&amp;#39;s lovely waiters/waitresses. Unfortunately, my friends and I had to wait and especially long time to do so. We had to wait SO long to the point where we took recreation in counting exactly how many minutes would pass before we were assisted. I wish I could tell you about how exactly long we had to wait but I lost count after 40 minutes. Upon being visited by the waitress we gave our orders and we were told that in the meantime while we waited for our drinks and entrees to be prepared; we would be given the restaurant&amp;#39;s supplemental bread dish to enjoy before our food was ready. Well, as soon as we got the bread we were met with the absolute displeasure of finding a thick disgusting, repulsive wad of pre-chewed gum on our bread. Of course we were not made aware of the fact that the bread was going to come with pre chewed bread and inquired whether or not we would have to pay extra for the additional gum piece. We were not given an explanation. But seeing as we were famished and how nowhere else to go we decided to abstain from consuming the bread and hoped that there would not be anymore surprise additional gum pieces emerging on any of our food. I have included below a picture of the gum which appeared on our bread for your viewing pleasure. Overall, our time here has been a horrible experience and though we decided to ignore the shortcomings of this venture. We will not be returning to this establishment. This might be by far the worst dining experience at a Chesapeake Cheesecake Factory franchise that I will ever have the dissatisfaction of experiencing. The only reason that this establishment is even receiving one star is because every meal for the rest of my life will now be better by comparison. If in the Maryland area, stay away from this place!

It then took the kitchen about 17 minutes to get a newly made sandwich out as my family was already done eating when it did. The server was kind about the situation but ultimately it boils down to the kitchen, when a mistake is made it should be top priority of the kitchen to remake the meal. Then it took about 15 minutes for a piece of cheesecake to get to us after we ordered it when we were all ready to leave. Not to mention we got no discount on the bill for the mistake with my order. Another point too is that appetizers are extremely over priced. We ordered a pretzel appetizer one time and only got a few pretzels and it was $12! Not to mention a small appetizer Cesar salad is $13. Lastly, I have to point out that the waiting area is way too small for the amount of costumers, I couldn&amp;#39;t imagine going on a Saturday night.

Management there has done a great job creating a culture that spoils it&amp;#39;s guests.<br&gt;<br&gt;Things I Don&amp;#39;t Like: <br&gt;- Prices are taller than usual chain restaurant, and quantities match. While paying a little extra is sometimes necessary to have better food, I feel the overbearing quantities that go to waste are what I am actually paying for. But some fans of Cheesecake Factory really value this aspect.<br&gt;- MAKING YOUR CUSTOMERS WAIT. On a Friday or Saturday night you will arrive and wait for a table between 45 minutes to an hour. A whole blob of impatient and hungry people get blinking vibrators to taunt them as they wait I a &amp;#34;holding pen&amp;#34; type if area. This is awful. CF doesn&amp;#39;t take reservations.

I no longer go to this restaurant on hose nights, and I go less often overall.<br&gt;<br&gt;In conclusion, any other day of the week besides Friday/Saturday, this place is great. I have them 4 stars.

My family and I went to the Cheesecake Factory for my sister&amp;#39;s birthday. Prior to this I had noticed that the Cheesecake Factory&amp;#39;s food wasn&amp;#39;t as good as it used to be. However, I loved the bread and the cheesecake and the food was better than most places so I would at least frequent this restaurant 2-3 times per year.<br&gt;<br&gt;This last visit however turned out to be the catalyst that ensures that I will never again visit any Cheesecake Factory!

However, that was not the &amp;#34;highlight&amp;#34; of the evening. One of my other sisters has a severe pineapple allergy. This was made clear when ordering drinks and food, to the point where my sister even chose a different drink because the staff was unsure what ingredients were in it(how does that work?)<br&gt;<br&gt;My sister asked whether or not the meal she was ordering had pineapples in it (Bang Bang Chicken &amp;amp; Shrimp). She was assured that it did not. If anyone has seen this particular dish, you know that it is completely covered with sauce. My sister received her meal and began to eat it, without really paying much attention. As she began to eat it, she began to cough severely and complain of trouble breathing to the point of tears. My mom immediately began to urge her to drink water as we looked for a benadryl to give her. My brother grabbed her plate and looked through her food and discovered not one but several pineapple chunks in the food. He tasted it to confirm.<br&gt;<br&gt;We gave her a benadryl and she could breathe a little better. So we called the manager over and explained the situation. We showed him the pineapple and he exclaimed&amp;#34; Oh my God. They&amp;#39;re all through the dish&amp;#34; He rushed back to the kitchen and came back with the Kitchen manager, who tried to persuade us that there weren&amp;#39;t any pineapples in the dish but rather it was applesauce! APPLESAUCE!<br&gt;<br&gt;What kind of morons, did he think we were to believe that a pineapple chunk was applesauce?! The kitchen manager became snide with us and at no point did they take responsibility for the mistake they made. My sister began to experience the worsening of symptoms. It was obvious that she needed something stronger than benadryl. We told them we were rushing my sister to Patient First because the benadryl wasn&amp;#39;t working and the manager says, &amp;#34;Oh yes, let me get your check to you so that you can be on your way&amp;#34; They wanted to make sure we paid before we went to see to my sister&amp;#39;s wellbeing!<br&gt;<br&gt;I later spoke to the general manager and my sister spoke to corporate. They refused to acknowledge the fact of what they&amp;#39;d done. The woman from corporate told my sister to take a picture next time.

Sometimes the parking garages can fill up fast. <br&gt;<br&gt;However, if you want to go here, I&amp;#39;d suggest NOT looking at the calorie content of your meal online OR of that cheesecake that you think you want to delight yourself with at the end...", "rating": 4, "date": "5/11/2010"}, {"text": "food excelent but staff was clueless and ignorent....think twice before stopping here....manager is just as clueless!!!", "rating": 2, "date": "5/30/2013"}, {"text": "I came here with a date because I was craving the Dulce De Leche cheesecake.

The food is always consistent across locations too, so that wasn&amp;#39;t my problem.<br&gt;<br&gt;My problem was the 3 hour dining time. After a half hour wait I had what might be the worst waiter I&amp;#39;ve ever had at any restaurant in my life. This guy, Thomas I think his name was (looks like a combination of Jack Sparrow / Spencer from Criminal minds) was horrible. I could&amp;#39;ve lived with the fact that he was socially retarded, but the the fact that I couldn&amp;#39;t live with is how shitty the service was. Not only did our glasses spend most of the time empty, but it seemed like he was trying to avoid coming to anybody&amp;#39;s table and whenever he did it was to remind us that he forgot to do whatever he said he was going to do. It seemed like it took a half hour for everything, half hour to bring us drinks, half hour to take our orders, half hour to bring us refills, check, dessert menu, etc. It was just frustrating because I didn&amp;#39;t intend to spend my whole night at a Cheesecake factory, dinner shouldn&amp;#39;t exceed an hour. I thought maybe we were being impatient but I heard the table across from us asking another waiter about him too because they didn&amp;#39;t seem to be a fan either.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never really felt the need to Yelp a chain restaurant before but I&amp;#39;d love to hear if other Yelpers have had this guy too and I hope maybe they can move him off of tables so people don&amp;#39;t go through what we did.", "rating": 2, "date": "9/12/2010"}, {"text": "As much as I love Cheesecake Factory, it&amp;#39;s actually not perfect. It has some major flaws. As great as the food is it&amp;#39;s been less and less about customer service. Lines are out the door, you are lucky enough to get a table on an off night or before the dinner rush. Forget any other time. If you get a table you are waiting a very long time for food. The food portions are very large but so are the prices. An appetizer could feed a family so if you wanna go cheap order an app. Though at this place cheap is unheard of. The ambiance is nice, great for a date type setting. 99 percent of the time food comes out great though once I went here and a bone wasn&amp;#39;t removed from the pulled pork and I hit my tooth on it and my friend&amp;#39;s burger was way undercooked. That&amp;#39;s what happens when they don&amp;#39;t quality check the food. We did get our meals comped on the same night and I got a replacement meal so they do try to make up for short comings. The menu is vast for apps meals and cheesecake varieties. Everyone can find something. So if you are willing to overlook flaws and wait...and wait for what you love then you will enjoy it here.", "rating": 4, "date": "10/4/2010"}, {"text": "The food is insanely fatty. \u00a0Pizzas are loaded up with cheese. \u00a0I felt horrible the next day. \u00a0I think this place might kill you if you eat there too often (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcalorielab.com%2Fnews%2F2007%2F07%2F28%2Fcalorie-pusher-comes-to-town-the-cheesecake-factory-hits-rochester%2F&amp;amp;s=a07a5762c921f103c507ff6f4ffaef53a042664c9df5770fce1ae1f93b6a934f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;calorielab.com/news/2007\u2026</a&gt;). \u00a0Other than that, it seems like a nice, family-oriented place.", "rating": 1, "date": "2/27/2010"}]}
