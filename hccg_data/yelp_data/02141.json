Now, to fast forward to the cheesecakes. My favorite dessert is cheesecake, so that being said...here&amp;#39;s the verdict on the ones we tried. First of all, one slice of cheesecake starts at 7.95 and go from there, depending on which one you choose and the portion size of course, and they are a very hearty portion slice!! So the first one was their Keylime...my son liked it, for me, it was good, but very tart. Now if you like tart, then you&amp;#39;ll love this. For me, it was good, but I personally would not order this, because I&amp;#39;m more of a sweet taste person. Next, Chocolate Mousse, my other son loved it and for me I did too...(just so you know, I only sampled the ones my kids had ). This was smooth and had a nice chocolate taste. My daughter had their Chocolate Cake, but she ate it all, so no sampling there, but she said it was yummy beyond words...at least she saved me from some calories lol!! \u00a0Now me, I ordered 2 cheesecakes to take home, because I&amp;#39;m the only one in our family of 9 that loves Pumpkin, so yes, their Pumpkin Cheesecake was full of pumpkin flavor and very, very delicious.

Okay...fine. So we pay the $35 (WOW, forgot how expensive they are) for the cake and wait. And wait...oh and wait...check in with them (&amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s not ready yet&amp;#34;)...and wait.

My friend kindly said &amp;#34;Sir, would you please remove these plates.&amp;#34; HE CUT HER OFF of course and said &amp;#34;YEAH, CAN I GIVE YOU WATER FIRST CAN I DO THIS FIRST!&amp;#34; I was at disbelief of what was going on and instead of grabbing the dirty plates he instead grabbed the appetizer plate with food still on it that we were STILL WORKING ON. I didn&amp;#39;t know what he was mad about, but he took the blame on us. We were so upset we didn&amp;#39;t even want to continue to talk to this man so we let him grab whatever he wanted that was in front of us. <br&gt;<br&gt;At this point we couldn&amp;#39;t take it anymore we were livid! He came back again and said to my friend &amp;#34;Are you still working on that?&amp;#34; mind you she didn&amp;#39;t have a single thing on her plate. We knew he was being a sarcastic jerk. She said &amp;#34;Well what am I working on there&amp;#39;s nothing on my plate.&amp;#34; He didn&amp;#39;t deserve a kind response so we gave him a little taste of his own medicine. He proceeds to ask if he can take it while being a smart alec. <br&gt;<br&gt;Finally he called a manager for us so we could complain about the horrendous service. She asked us if everything was okay. Clearly not. Everything was far from okay. We explained to her what had happened. She asked if we wanted a different server and we said yes. We both came out for a nice dinner so we never let his poor service ruin our evening until the moment he decided to argue with us about removing the plates from before. Midway through the evening we still didn&amp;#39;t even know his name. After speaking to the manager he didn&amp;#39;t even bother to come and apologize. As we left we saw him laugh at us. He was not only a terrible server, but he&amp;#39;s a bully who is clearly not right for hospitality. No one should ever have to endure or feel as horrible as this man made us feel.

It wasn&amp;#39;t too busy and we were sat towards the back which I didn&amp;#39;t mind at all. The food was good and the atmosphere is quiet, however the service wasn&amp;#39;t great at all. <br&gt;<br&gt;I was a waitress for years and normally try not to complain about service but it really made our time unpleasant. We had a younger girl as our waitress, didn&amp;#39;t catch her name but it seemed as though she definitely did not want to be there and certainly didn&amp;#39;t want us there either.<br&gt;<br&gt;Everything was fine in the beginning as she took our drink order and offered us bread. Once she brought those over we put in for an appetizer, the Thai chicken wraps which were good. When the appetizer was brought over she came over and immediately took the bread off the table which we had barely touched without asking which I thought was a little strange. We put in for the rest of our order when she brought the appetizer over. Fast forward to when we were done with the appetizer she came to clear the plates and left my dirty silverware on the table and instead took away the clean set. It was extremely awkward as she cleared the table as she seemed to just be aggressively throwing the silverware and plates onto the appetizer dish to clear up. Definitely wasn&amp;#39;t getting a friendly or welcoming vibe from her whatsoever. Once our food came out, I got the Parmesan herb crusted chicken and my boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken, I had to ask the food runner for clean silverware as she had taken mine.<br&gt;<br&gt;As we were nearing the end of the meal she came over and my boyfriend asked to have his food wrapped up. I didn&amp;#39;t even have a chance to ask for mine wrapped as she grabbed his plate and whipped around and walked off so fast. She came back with his food and again immediately walked away so quickly I couldn&amp;#39;t ask for my food to be wrapped up. When she finally did come back I was able to get my food wrapped up and we asked for a dessert menu. My guess is she probably wasn&amp;#39;t going to offer one because she certainly didn&amp;#39;t want us there any longer. We ordered one piece of cheesecake to split and she brought it over with our check but insisted there was &amp;#34;no rush&amp;#34;.<br&gt;<br&gt;After we finished up dessert she asked if we were all set with the check, which we hadn&amp;#39;t even touched it yet as we were still eating but we put the cash in anyways. She came over and asked if it was all set again. We said yes and she asked &amp;#34;do you need change?&amp;#34; My boyfriend said no and that was the end. No &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;have a nice night&amp;#34;, nothing. To spend over $80 on dinner and feel extremely uncomfortable and rushed the entire time was just not worth it whatsoever. We were checked on maybe 2-3 times the entire night and never once asked/offered refills for our drinks. We would&amp;#39;ve asked ourselves but barely got to speak as she spun around and ran from our table the few times she did come over.

I love cheesecake (and make quite a bit of it) and I have always loved the food at Cheesecake Factory. <br&gt;<br&gt;So when we get there and there is an estimated 2 hour wait, I decide to go back to work while everyone is waiting to finish up and have them call me when our table was ready because I only work 10 minutes away.<br&gt;<br&gt;I go back to work and work for more than an hour, stop by Devon&amp;#39;s to drop off some things that I had for her and the call from Ligaya comes that says that the table is almost ready.

How long could it take for them to serve pre-made, Pre-sliced cheesecake. <br&gt;<br&gt;Some people ordered drinks, I think the table ordered one app total (at least that was all that I saw being brought to the table) but most of us just ordered cheesecake. I was told by my sitter that I could only stay out so late if I brought her back some cheesecake, so when I ordered I ordered one slice to go (at the regular price) and one slice for me to enjoy with my Yelp friends.<br&gt;<br&gt;After a while, I think at about the same time the app came to the table, a waiter came over with my to go slice of cheesecake. Cool, we will be served soon, right? After about 45 minutes of staring at my to go container of cheese cake, the Yelpers are wanting me to fork it over. But I can&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s for Ann Marie! \u00a0I predict they have run out of cheesecake and they are waiting for the frozen cheesecakes to thaw before they serve us.<br&gt;<br&gt;So I decide to go over and find out what the hold up is and see if they can make my other slice of cheesecake to go also because I have to leave and pick up my son and it&amp;#39;s already after 11.

I ask what&amp;#39;s going on and someone says, &amp;#34;we are very busy and the only thing that people are ordering is Cheesecake and we are doing our best to get the Cheesecake out to your table&amp;#34; I explained that I had to leave and was told that it would be out shortly. <br&gt;<br&gt;One of the people behind the counter asked what I was waiting for so they could try to get it out first but the other woman cut her off and said &amp;#34;They decided to have this big promotion today and we have 4 people working and all of these tables to serve, your food will be out shortly&amp;#34; and I looked for the other woman who was trying to help get mine so that I could leave but she wasn&amp;#39;t there anymore.<br&gt;<br&gt;I go back to the table thinking shortly, I can deal with shortly but we wait and wait and still no cheesecake.

If you have 4 people doing it, one person gets the cheesecake, one person plates the cheesecake, one person garnishes with whipped cream and one person makes sure the order is right and passes on to the server.

My martini was room temperature and I did not get the side of rocks I requested... ok, larger group, I&amp;#39;ll deal.<br&gt;<br&gt;So we ordered drinks, 1 appetizer, and 13 (that should have been an omen, guys) slices of cheesecake for here, 2 to go. Server comes back, they are out of the appetizer ordered- no problem, ordered a different Appetizer which came out in about 10-15 minutes. Then we waited...<br&gt;<br&gt;And laughed with each other and waited...<br&gt;<br&gt;The two to go slices arrive...<br&gt;<br&gt;And laughed with each other and waited (notice a pattern)...<br&gt;<br&gt;Look around, tables seated after us got their food and desserts... and all the servers are sitting around the front of the restaurant chatting away. Meanwhile no drink refills were offered and most of us ran out of water (those that did actually did have water poured some of theirs into their neighbors empty glasses). We actually felt we were not being attended to because the server knew the gratuity would be added to the party. One of us gets up and informs the manager of our situation as we sit in the near empty dining room. Server comes back, I ask for water refills, they are refilled within 5 minutes.<br&gt;<br&gt;And we laughed with each other and waited (at this point for over an hour)...<br&gt;<br&gt;Another member informs the manager we still don&amp;#39;t have our cheesecake. Another server comes by and tells us there are only four people working in the dessert pantry (I have been in the business for 20 years and know that is insufficient for this night), OK, how about planning ahead? <br&gt;<br&gt;And we laughed with each other and waited...<br&gt;<br&gt;Finally, after 1 hour and 25 minutes of being seated, the cheesecake arrives. Delirious to see the Holy Grail of our quest, we dig in... it was good, although two of them were still frozen, but we dealt with it. Besides the restaurant was nearly empty and they were mopping around us- bathroom trip and exit from restaurant included sliding feet-- how about clean water, wet floor signs, and waiting until guests leave next time). I did not order a second drink since I was already over it.<br&gt;<br&gt;We get the bill, nothing was adjusted, but the gratuity was still added (of course). It also would have been nice if the manager visited the table and at least acknowledged the problem. The kicker after we paid? The server (Paco) came over and confronting us about speaking to the manager and stated that she yelled at the servers in front of their gossip gathering. He also stated that they ran out of cheesecakes... hello... planning ahead? Or how about letting us know so we can select another instead of frozen ones? Summary thus far: 4 1/2+ hour cheesecake, good but not that good. <br&gt;<br&gt;Second kicker? We got out so late the subway stopped running and the car was locked in the parking garage and we had to get a security guard zipping around on a Segway to let us out.<br&gt;<br&gt;So if you want to go next year to celebrate National Cheesecake Day, I suggest the following alternative- July is also National:<br&gt;July Belongs to Blueberries Month,<br&gt;Ice Cream Month,<br&gt;National Baked Beans Month (feel free to make the beans yourself from scratch- you&amp;#39;d still get them faster than the cheesecake...)<br&gt;<br&gt;As for me, next year, I may wait for 08 Aug and celebrate National Sneak Some Zucchini on Your Neighbor&amp;#39;s Porch Night (I swear I did not just make that up) with the great people I dined with...", "rating": 1, "date": "7/31/2008"}, {"text": "As all my National Cheesecake Day cohorts have already weighed in on the lengthy fiasco, I feel compelled to opine on the matter myself. \u00a0Also because I am told one must review something to be considered a &amp;#34;yelper.&amp;#34; \u00a0But I digress. \u00a0On most days, Cheesecake Factory is not a single star establishment. \u00a0National Cheesecake Day is not most days.<br&gt;<br&gt;You might think that a factory which turns out cheesecake would be equipped to handle the wave of pilgrims on cheesecake&amp;#39;s holiest of days. \u00a0You would be mistaken. \u00a0You might think that the departure of all the other restaurant patrons (having already been served and finished their meals) would cause your cheesecakes to appear. \u00a0Again, you would be mistaken. \u00a0You might think that that after being ignored for about an hour the wait staff would eschew sass in favor of a kind, conciliatory tone. \u00a0You would again be mistaken. \u00a0You might even think that they would throw in an extra slice or sing as song as though it were your birthday with the cheesecakes finally do arrive. \u00a0Sadly, you would be mistaken yet again.<br&gt;<br&gt;I won&amp;#39;t get into the minutiae of the evening, as that has been more eloquently done by others, so I&amp;#39;ll sum up my review as follows:<br&gt;<br&gt;Start with 5 stars for $1.50 slice of cheesecake, subtract 1 star for every hour it takes to get said cheesecake. \u00a0In our case, this leaves you with 1 star. \u00a0(If you want to give them the benefit of the doubt and not count the wait time for the table, then take off those other two stars anyway for their lack of compassion.)<br&gt;<br&gt;As mentioned elsewhere, the company of the yelpers and the merriment that was made was a 5-star affair. \u00a0The Factory had little to do with this, however, so they&amp;#39;re still stuck with 1.<br&gt;<br&gt;Who&amp;#39;da thunk my first yelp would be such a burn?", "rating": 1, "date": "7/31/2008"}, {"text": "My most recent experience at the Cheesecake Factory was with a dozen other Yelpers who seem to be covering every detail of the evening in excruciating detail, which means I get to write a brief review (for once). \u00a0Thanks guys!<br&gt;<br&gt;Every experience I&amp;#39;ve ever had with the Cheesecake Factory has involved waiting. \u00a0I don&amp;#39;t know if they invented the little vibrating pagers, but they&amp;#39;ve taken their use to an almost sadistic level. \u00a0I used to work at a bookstore in a mall next to a Cheesecake Factory, and I guarantee that 60% of our sales during dinner time were from people waiting for their table at the Cheesecake Factory.<br&gt;<br&gt;Yes, the food is pretty good. \u00a0Yes, those avocado egg rolls are AMAZING. \u00a0Yes, some people have developed romantic relationships with the cheesecake. \u00a0But after my last visit involved \u00a0over four hours of waiting for a single slice of cheesecake, I think takeout is now the only acceptable form of dining at the Cheesecake Factory.<br&gt;<br&gt;EDIT: and I almost forgot, they were OUT of the egg rolls! \u00a0WTF?!?", "rating": 2, "date": "7/31/2008"}, {"text": "Sloppy bitchy slow takeout pickup.

Long waits.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Cheesecake Factory is a recent discovery for me, but one that I&amp;#39;m very pleased to have made. The first time I tried to go, I got turned off by the 45 minute wait to seat 1 and elected to leave. On subsequent visits, though, it was a pleasant experience. If you get there early (between 5-6) the wait isn&amp;#39;t bad, even on a Friday night. On a weekend mealtime, though, waits are steadily long, so don&amp;#39;t go if you&amp;#39;re in a hurry. But if you get stuck waiting, you can always peruse the mall while you&amp;#39;re killing time. Or use the time productively by reading the novel-length menu to start trying to decide what you want. An added pro: the bar is open seating, so start with a drink while you wait.<br&gt;<br&gt;Ahh, yes - the drinks. The Cheesecake Factory has a section of four &amp;#34;Super Creamy&amp;#34; signature drinks - I have now tried them all, and can safely conclude that they&amp;#39;re all fantastic! If you&amp;#39;ve got a hankering for girly drinks, definitely try one. Warning, though: in the Flying Gorilla and the Strawberry Creamsicle, you can&amp;#39;t even taste the alcohol - generally resulting in sucking them down far too quickly and going back for more. I find those types of drinks particularly dangerous.<br&gt;<br&gt;The menu is voluminous and very diverse. No matter what you&amp;#39;re in the mood for, you should find something here to satisfy you. The food is very good quality and full of flavor. Do *not* expect to eat a full portion, though - either plan to split it with someone or take leftovers home. The serving sizes are easily two meals, especially if you elect an appetizer or dessert. And you will probably only be able to handle one or the other - if you&amp;#39;re going to have an entree, be warned that appetizer + entree = no room for dessert. Likewise, entree + dessert = no room for appetizer. Eating here is definitely about picking and choosing.<br&gt;<br&gt;The tab can get expensive - especially if you add drinks and appetizer/desert. I&amp;#39;ve easily spent $80-$100 for two people.

Go to an Italian community and buy a whole cheesecakefor the same price!<br&gt;<br&gt;Next, the food is TOO oily - I&amp;#39;m talking Paula Deen here folks! \u00a0I had the Evelyn pasta at Thanksgiving time, and some pesto dish right before Christmas. The Evelyn dish was bland and grease-filled. The pasta itself was a little too al dente and it appeared dessicated, as if had been under the warmer too long. The most recent time, with the pesto dish, there was so much oil that I had to put paper napkins in my plate to absorb the excess! Of course, I should have spoken up. However, the waiter walked by twice and blithely pretended not to notice.<br&gt;<br&gt;On a side note, there was a little verbal spat between two of the waitstaff.

A week ago I had fish tacos for the first time in San Diego at Rubio&amp;#39;s--a cheap fast-food joint that serves fish tacos. I liked them. So I tried them when I got back to Cambridge, and figured I&amp;#39;d try &amp;#39;em at TCF--at 4 times the price, they should be at least decent, right? WRONG! The tortillas, which for some odd reason were doubled on each taco, tasted bland, there was WAY too much unseasoned cabbage (about 80% of the filling, by my estimate), and at the bottom was some oddly tasteless fish that had some kind of coloring that one would think might be seasoning. But one would be wrong. It has to just be food coloring. There was &amp;#34;pico de gallo&amp;#34; on the side, consisting of diced tomatoes and nothing else (God save us from anything like seasoning or spice!), along with a lump of what they consider guacamole--presumably a lump of old library paste that had green food coloring added and a couple of pencil erasers. This was one of the blandest meals I&amp;#39;ve ever had... oh, and another thing, there was a drop of special sauce in each of the tacos--I know, because that one drop that was supplied fell on my shirt, where I got a chance to taste it. It wasn&amp;#39;t bad. But what&amp;#39;s with the rationing? Are we having a national fish taco sauce shortage? Did I not have enough rationing stamps? The meal came with rice (yellow minute rice with bird&amp;#39;s eye vegetable bits thrown in) and black beans (possibly the high point of the meal--not too much to screw up between the can and the plate).<br&gt;<br&gt;To sum up, the food tastes awful, the service is unusually busy, and hence have no time for actual individual interaction with customers, and the prices are outlandish.
