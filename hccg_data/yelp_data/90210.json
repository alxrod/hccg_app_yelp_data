We decided to tipped her that amount because the bus boy was extremely sweet and nice and he deserved a good tip. We were so closed in tipping the bus boy half of the tips on his hands but decided to just leave it on the table. <br&gt;I ordered ice water with lemons (lemons didn&amp;#39;t come) I had to asked again and Sofija seemed annoyed by me for asking for things but that&amp;#39;s because she didn&amp;#39;t bring them since the beginning and I had to keep remind her!

For main entree I ordered the shrimp scampi from the skinny menu (I always always order that) I think waitress put the wrong order and I had do send it back she argued with me saying that&amp;#39;s what I ordered and I said no that&amp;#39;s not what I ordered. She ended up taking it back. 20 mins later I got my dish my family was half done but it&amp;#39;s okay it happens. I asked for more bread and she literally brought two Lorelei pieces of bread with no butter I had to ask her for more butter and again she didn&amp;#39;t seem very happy.

It was blah! And used to be a lot better years ago. I&amp;#39;ve been dining at this restaurant for decades! We had the tamale cakes which actually used to be A LOT better! They just don&amp;#39;t taste the same, Also ordered asian lettuce tacos, tartare, and a chipotle pasta that actually tasted OK. The almond salmon said was too dry, and chicken littles didn&amp;#39;t have much flavor. In my experience, the food USED to be soooo much better! But I digress, because the family seemed to be in a happy mood and we were there to celebrate a birthday. It was supposed to be a joyous occasion! We&amp;#39;ve come here for countless birthdays in the past, and they used to always be amazing, but things have really gone down hill.<br&gt;<br&gt;Somehow, after we sat down, we realized we had the exact same waiter as the last time we came to this establishment, just two weeks ago. \u00a0They must always use the same waiters on the same tables, because we sat in the very same spot, in the front, next to the window. This used to be a desirable location, but not anymore. <br&gt;<br&gt;Things were going okay, our waiter even agreed to come sing happy birthday to us when we ordered a piece of godiva cheesecake. This is when things took a turn for the absolute worst. A crew of waiters came to sing us their rendition of Happy Birthday, which was fine, but then right after the singing, I heard our waiter (the same person who brought us our iced tea and took our order) say the &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; word. Right after the birthday song, the guy chuckled, and said &amp;#34;F*%CK!&amp;#34; There were kids around!!! I could not believe it! We don&amp;#39;t speak like that at home, so we never would have thought that going to, what used to be a family restaurant, we would have experienced something like that! Children should not have to be subject to the F word at public establishments. It was COMPLETELY inappropriate! I couldn&amp;#39;t imagine a worst thing to say right after singing happy birthday. My jaw dropped and I looked at my family in total disbelief. \u00a0This was the same person who stunk of drugs the last time we came to this restaurant, and now he was using profanity! We shouldn&amp;#39;t have to be exposed to these sort of things when we choose to dine out. This is why I will NEVER be back!<br&gt;<br&gt;I am not the type to tattle and did not want to make a big deal of it while I was there, and ruin our birthday celebration even more, \u00a0but my wife and I want to leave this here as a warning to parents: Do not take your family to this restaurant! It is not a safe place for our precious children! The waitstaff is completely inappropriate, and will curse or smell of refer. If you care about your kids, please avoid this place!

I appreciate the generous portions, menu variety and of course the cheesecakes!! However this particular visit to this location left me feeling highly underwhelmed and let down.<br&gt;<br&gt;While usually solid in the entr\u00e9e quality department, tonight was far from solid. First up we had the Buffalo Blasts - ok they came thru pretty well except we did notice the spice wasn&amp;#39;t as noticeable as we have had on other occasions at other CFs. We had literally dunk the blasts in the buffalo sauce cup to get the full kick of flavor - not typical. <br&gt;<br&gt;We also ordered up the Fried Shrimp. First time with this entr\u00e9e and boy it was a miss. The mentioned that the shrimp are butterflied but that actually was part of the problem. Butterflying the shrimp led to the shrimp tasting extremely dry and chewy. The breading wasn&amp;#39;t any help either. A batter dip would have been better. The coleslaw that came with it was tasteless as well. Oh but not to worry about the fries - there&amp;#39;s plenty of those. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;Next up was the Chicken Enchiladas. Upon ordering, this sounded great - I hadn&amp;#39;t tried these here yet, so I was looking forward to it. Ugh what a mistake. The presentation was very attractive but the taste again was a real let down. Zero flavor and spice to this dish. Yeap - bland Mexican dish. Impossible right? Good amounts of cheese but the sauce and chicken was really below run of the mill. I was pretty surprised. Rice was like sticky white rice with some pesto sauce brushed on it. If I scooped in the rice was actually white in clumps. Uhh not Mexican rice at all. Beans were... well black beans - actually the best part of the meal. No to-go box needed for this plate of leftovers. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ok one dish that came thru was the Spicy Cashew Chicken on rice. This was a specialty dish. Good amounts of chicken cooked well. The sauce was nice with a good kick of spice. Plenty of rice - this was a winner. Enough to share. <br&gt;<br&gt;Another bright spot was my Pineapple Mojito. It came with a bunch of ice but was made pretty strong, as was the dirty martini we had. Bartender was serving well tonight. <br&gt;<br&gt;Of course the cheesecakes did not disappoint. Smores cheesecake was huge with marshmallows and graham crackers on top. The other cheesecake ordered was the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee cheesecake - excellent. Creamy and not to sweet. <br&gt;<br&gt;So along the lines of food taste we had two huge strikeouts. I mean I didn&amp;#39;t think The Cheesecake Factory could let me down, but tonight it definitely did. Another blow to the dining experience was the overall cleanliness of the restaurant. We were seated next to the kitchen swinging door and the floor was always a mess. I mean if you got up to leave your table you would be ice skating on the grease on the slippery floor. Later I would see busboys dragging bags or cloth bags of trash across the floor - no doubt smearing the slimy filth across customer&amp;#39;s walking paths. Gross and actually dangerous. I saw several other patron doing the arms out balance dance. <br&gt;<br&gt;I was really shocked by the overall experience - especially while dining in the 90210 Beverly Hills restaurant.

(Bonus puzzle: Why was there a dog inside?)<br&gt;<br&gt;We got seated at an outdoor table, which was perfect at 6:30pm.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food, as it always is, was good.

The standardization in their menu is honestly part of what makes CF so reliably good. <br&gt;<br&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t get bread when we sat down, so we asked for it.<br&gt;<br&gt;It took a little while to get our drink orders taken, and when the drinks arrived, we asked for bread again.<br&gt;<br&gt;After five more minutes, we flagged someone down and asked for bread again.<br&gt;<br&gt;When the waiter came to take our order, he mentioned that bread was on the way.

He said he&amp;#39;d check. Five minutes later, he brought all the food but the fresh rolls.

He brought the bread with one butter, remember we were in 5, then I asked for one more butter and he just shakes his head like &amp;#34;afff, seriously&amp;#34; and brought another butter almost throwing it on us.

We walked by Caffe Roma, which my friend had recommended, but it was SO LOUD and felt like a night in WeHo, when we were friends wanting to catch up and talk to each other. So we came to Cheesecake Factory, which I guess was fine for one of my picky eater friends!<br&gt;<br&gt;Saturday night, around 9:45pm, we waited 10-15 mins to be seated. Not crazy like 1-2 hr wait, but come on, on a saturday night so late?! The restaurant was packed. <br&gt;<br&gt;Kurt was our waiter, and he was kind of snooty. He kept trying to up-sell things to us, which we hated, like adding on chicken to your salad, adding this or that, etc. And it was in a way where he had that tone of, &amp;#34;Are you SURE you DON&amp;#39;T want to add chicken to your salad? It&amp;#39;s really small.&amp;#34; I really hate when people try to do it to me, especially if they aren&amp;#39;t nice.

Very strange. <br&gt;<br&gt;On the other hand, we had a super nice bus boy who was very sweet. You could tell that he was very genuine and treated his customers (including us) well. Crazy story - my friend was wearing one of those skirts that zips from top to bottom in the back, and for some crazy reason, it unzipped where you could see her butt. She was leaving for the night, then felt it and sat down embarrassingly, then bus boy came over trying to make it better by saying it was alright, and offering her a napkin. It was so funny, because although he was super sweet, it just made the embarrassing situation even more noticeable. LOL. There was no moral to this story, I just wanted to share it because I thought it was hilarious, and it just shows how nice the bus boy was. <br&gt;<br&gt;Anyway, I ordered two drinks: \u00a0Peach Blended Bellini, and the Asian Pear Martini. Both were fantastic, except there was probably no reason to card me since it tasted like there was no alcohol in them. They were $9 and $12 respectively, which came out to 21 before tax and tip, which added up to pretty expensive for just drinks, that barely gave me a buzz. I guess, what does one really expect from the Cheesecake Factory though? <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m frustrated that I came here, but I were forced to come back because of picky eater friends, I&amp;#39;d probably insist at sitting at the bar, and getting my Blended Peach Bellini.

I did expect a wait, after all, this is Cheesecake Factory. And if I&amp;#39;m not mistaken, this Beverly Hills location is the original. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;The woman at the front was bustling and trying to take names, and continuously keep track of which tables were available. She told us it&amp;#39;d be a 15 minute wait, but it was more like 30. Not her fault, she was very diligent, but I wish she gave us a more accurate time estimate. <br&gt;<br&gt;When we were seated, our server came by and asked what we&amp;#39;d like to drink. He brought us our water, and fortunately told us bread was on the way. I was absolutely famished and relieved at the sight of sourdough and honey wheat bread with butter on the side. \u00a0Lukewarm, but still very good. We ordered and waited a while for our food. <br&gt;<br&gt;As we waited I looked around the restaurant. It was cozy, and much smaller than other Cheesecake Factories that I&amp;#39;ve been. The design of the place seemed simpler too. The walls were still shades of brown, yellow, &amp;amp; orange tones that are familiar to Cheesecake Factory, but there weren&amp;#39;t as many intricate and elaborate designs on the walls or of the decor. Just compare this to the Cheesecake Factory, at say, the Grove and you&amp;#39;ll see what I mean. It&amp;#39;s not a bad thing, just something I noticed. <br&gt;<br&gt;I noticed we got our food fairly quick at this location, so that is a plus. However, the food was disappointing. I got the Texan rolls which were basically oily fried eggrolls in a weird green sauce that had a bit of hot sauce in it. The way the hot sauce was added to the green sauce made it look like it had been dropped in there by accident which turned me off a little. Kinda gross. The sauce had a pretty weak flavor overall. <br&gt;<br&gt;A pretty lackluster experience which was made worse by an annoying bratty little boy who obnoxiously laughed and yelled and took pictures of everyone in the restaurant. Call me a bit heartless, but one can only take so much of a little boy going up to one&amp;#39;s table and taking pictures of the people there, very up close. It gets annoying after it&amp;#39;s gone on for an hour and a half. Not the restaurant&amp;#39;s fault, the waiters seemed annoyed with him too, but it really ruined the experience for me even further. Definitely not coming back. <br&gt;<br&gt;So factors of the long wait, annoying brat, lackluster food, and blah experience contributed to why I didn&amp;#39;t think the food was worth the price (standard pricing for all cheesecake factories, but I usually don&amp;#39;t have a bad time) and why I gave a bad review.

She clearly said, it isn&amp;#39;t quite ready yet. \u00a0I txt the person who ordered and she&amp;#39;s upset cos she was told her order was ready 30mins ago. I hand the phone over to the lady who I spoke to and she tells the person the order has been ready. \u00a0So, here we go ...<br&gt;We get into it and the woman at Cheesecake Factory pushes the order to me and that was it.<br&gt;The nerve of this woman, at &amp;#39;to go&amp;#39; section to lie to me and the person who ordered didn&amp;#39;t surprise me cos ive heard workers in this section make up lies to customers picking up or ordering.

I&amp;#39;d question the sterilization of everything at this location. <br&gt;<br&gt;The cooks can&amp;#39;t keep up with the pace of orders and customers need to be told the truth of wait time that is 45mins from time of order when place is busy and not lied to that the crappy food has been ready. \u00a0Ridiculous.<br&gt;<br&gt;HIGHLIGHT: The host section and the bar section is the only organized and friendly staff you come across.

We opted for the Orange Chicken (lightly battered white chicken pieces, smothered in an orange sauce, with veggies and brown rice) and \u00a0Cashew Chicken (lightly battered chicken pieces in a spicy asian sauce with brown rice)....both were $16.99 each.

READ BEFORE EATING HERE!! WORST EXPERIENCE AT A RESTAURANT EVER!!! Imagine having a wonderful day and you make plans to go to good old Cheesecake Factory. You&amp;#39;re enjoying the great sweet bread when all of a sudden the busser slams a plate of butter onto your table. It&amp;#39;s okay, I was being patient and understood the guy probably hated being there for some reason. So when I turned over to him and asked for new butter since he threw it onto my gf and it got all over her clothes, I simply asked if we could have another plate of butter since he threw the last one. Honestly I should&amp;#39;ve flipped on the guy, but I thought maybe he didn&amp;#39;t realize what he just did. I was WRONG. The guy was probably the most rude staff member I have ever experienced at a restaurant. The fact that he holds a job in an industry meant to serve people is mind blowing. When I asked for the butter replacement he yelled, &amp;#34;go ask your waitress!&amp;#34; And I replied, &amp;#34;excuse me? Did you not just see how you threw that butter and dropped it on my gf?&amp;#34; And he yelled again, &amp;#34;well go ask your waitress!&amp;#34; I think the people around us were shocked at how crazed this guy was. My blood was boiling and did everything to not smack some sense into his foolish behavior. So I requested to speak to the manager and he had a fat smile on his face saying, &amp;#34;okay let&amp;#39;s go talk to the manager.&amp;#34; As soon as I approached the manager I explained how cruel and unacceptable this behavior was while the guy was standing next to the manager bickering about how the waitress should be taking care of us and not him, and the manager was even trying to shut him up but he wouldn&amp;#39;t stop talking. The managers response to me was, &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;ll talk to him.&amp;#34; Wow... they seemed pretty buddy buddy so I know he didn&amp;#39;t say anything. If I were the manager I would&amp;#39;ve told the guy to go home (cause he clearly didn&amp;#39;t want to be there that day) and let us eat in peace. Instead, we left because we were uncomfortable that this guy was still going to be there after he was being aggressive and cruel towards us. I will NEVER STEP FOOT IN THIS LOCATION AGAIN. And if this company really cared about business and it&amp;#39;s customers, that manager should be replaced or trained, and the bussser should&amp;#39;ve been fired.

I remember enjoying it about 5 years ago, but after dish after dish of disappointment and bad service (and possibly bad luck), I&amp;#39;ve decided to write a review for this Cheesecake Factory location. <br&gt;<br&gt;I used to looooooove cheesecake factory. The environment looked very nice, and they have great variety, as well as amazing cheesecakes. Service used to be better, but my recent experiences were just the opposite. <br&gt;<br&gt;This is from my most recent experience:<br&gt;<br&gt;We got in and waited, but no one was there to greet and seat us. Once someone came by, we got seated quickly, which was good. The waitress said that she can take our baby&amp;#39;s stroller away and bring us a high chair. The bf collapsed the stroller to save room, but it took nearly ten minutes for the high chair to come. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our orders were taken, and she said that she will bring us our bread and butter. That never showed up. Other tables got bread and butter, but we did not. We also were not offered refills of water. <br&gt;<br&gt;It took a long time for our appetizer to come out. We got the buffalo wings that day because I wanted something spicy, and we can feed chicken to our little one. Once we were done with the wings, we waited nearly half an hour for our entrees to show up. Ahhh.. that means we had to pay for parking in that 2 hour free lot, since we waited so much already! <br&gt;<br&gt;Anyways, the buffalo wings were just decent. Not worth the money. The sauce tasted great, but the meat itself was just super dry. I&amp;#39;ve had better from Domino&amp;#39;s. Quite depressing, huh? <br&gt;<br&gt;So our entrees finally came. We ordered the grilled chicken kids meal for the little one, the burrito for the bf, and the chinese chicken salad for myself. The kids meal was a total rip off. Our little one refused to eat any of it! She normally loves chicken, but she kept spitting it out. UGH!! Oh, it was just super dry. Gross. <br&gt;My salad looked smaller than the other times I&amp;#39;ve ordered it. Maybe I should have stuck with a sandwich or a burger. The salad was drenched and all disgusting, as if it was just sitting out there for at least half an hour. There was only a few small pieces of chicken inside. TOTAL RIPOFF! It used to be great, but that salad to price ratio was the worst ever. Other chains, such as cpk, now offers better chinese chicken salads. Sorry, cheesecake factory... what happened to yours?? I would have ordered the tuna tataki salad, but I&amp;#39;m pregnant again, soooo that was out of the question for uber safety issues. <br&gt;At least the bf&amp;#39;s burrito was decent. The presentation was one long burrito on an oval plate with sauce and tomatoes on top of it. It was the most worthwhile thing we got that day. It came with a side of guacamole, sour cream, and black beans. <br&gt;<br&gt;Sooooo.... overall, Cheesecake Factory has declined a lot. Portions used to be bigger, service used to be better, and I&amp;#39;ve always got my free bread and butter, but that experience... nope. Horrible. Just horrible. I was lucky that I paid mostly in giftcards because if I were to use my own hard earned cash at this place, I&amp;#39;d be super pissed. Sad that the San Vincente location in west LA closed.. *SIGH* <br&gt;<br&gt;In the past, I&amp;#39;ve tried the following: <br&gt;tons of fun burger (decent), chicken enchiladas (yum), veggie burger (decent), mushroom burger (way too greasy), chicken teriyaki (too many fat chunks), chicken picatta (second grossest thing I&amp;#39;ve had here), pulled pork sandwich (lacking the meats quite a bit), fish tacos (okay), tuna takaki salad (probably my favorite entree, but such a small portion), the navajo (good sandwich), chicken sandwich (okay), fish and chips (use extra sauce and ketchup in case of dryness), lettuce wraps (used to be better as well), chicken pot stickers (so small!), avocado eggrolls (meh), and more. <br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also tried most their cheesecake menu, and those at least were always par or better. My faves are the vanilla bean, dulce de leche, and tiramisu.

I would start adding the word &amp;#34;Burger&amp;#34; to the name.<br&gt;<br&gt;A friend and I had a free Sunday after we cancelled a wine tasting event due to possible inclimate weather (this never materialized), so we had an open day of psuedo-spontaneity which took us from the Valley, to the Eastside, Mid-Wilshire, and ultimately to the Westside at The Cheesecake Factory in Beverly Hills. Neither of us have been to this location, and I was driven by the $25.00 gift card that needed to be used.<br&gt;<br&gt;Although my phone&amp;#39;s GPS guided us here, we initially missed it because of a tall leafy tree covering up the store&amp;#39;s neon sign out front. It was around 8pm when we finally walked in, and the place was packed...but not packed enough to seat us immediately. I can honestly say this was the first time I&amp;#39;ve never had to wait to be seated. Karma was on our side this even, and in fact, the entire day.<br&gt;<br&gt;At this point, we were both starving, so it took us some time to figure out what to eat because everything we saw around us and what we read on the menu was appealing to us. After getting glasses of water and at least decided on a blended mango margarita for me ($10.95), and a &amp;#34;skinny-style&amp;#34; red raspberry martini ($8.95) for my friend. I eventually decided on the Macaroni &amp;amp; Cheese Burger ($11.95) and substituted for sweet potato fries ($1.00 extra), and the Fish Tacos ($13.95) for my friend. To finish off the meal, we had the Reese&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake ($7.95).<br&gt;<br&gt;While we carried on our insightful conversation and exhorted about our day&amp;#39;s adventures, we enjoyed our drinks and the table bread and butter. I can&amp;#39;t speak about her martini but I do love their margaritas, and this instance was no different. Our food soon came out and man did it smell amazing! Again, I can&amp;#39;t speak about her fish tacos, but my glamburger was about to take over the world...like Kim Kardashian&amp;#39;s ass! I literally had to size this bad boy up. Two encounters with humongous burgers in recent weeks, I don&amp;#39;t think my heart can take it anymore! The best plan of action was to stack everything together and smash it all down, so at least it&amp;#39;s manageable for me to wrap my pie-hole around it. I truly do love their assortment of glamburgers, and I&amp;#39;ve never tried this one before. No words can do justice how much I thoroughly enjoyed the combination of throwing a dollop of fried mac &amp;amp; cheese on top of my burger patty - ingenious! In order to have room for dessert, I had to have half of this and my always tasty sweet potato fries packed-up for a later meal. Now, I&amp;#39;ve had the Reese&amp;#39;s cheesecake which happens to be one of my favorites, and my friend loves peanut butter, so we were both on a peanut butter high. We amazingly polished off the cheesecake, probably to our detriment. \u00a0 <br&gt;<br&gt;One other thing (mentioned the waiting earlier) I&amp;#39;ve always had an issue with them was their service. This time, I couldn&amp;#39;t praise the service more. Our attractive waitress, Amanda, was very attentive and accommodating. Our water glasses were always filled (very important to me), and she was able to include some marinara sauce on my burger (I guess it normally doesn&amp;#39;t) as it does when you only order the mac &amp;amp; cheese. I should have asked for her number (I was with a more familial female friend so it would have been fine)! <br&gt;<br&gt;Parking is everywhere, from the street, valet, and parking structures. We parked in the structure across the street with a flat $5.00 fee.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I&amp;#39;m usually not a fan of chain restaurants (I do list Elephant Bar, Outback Steakhouse, Claim Jumpers, and Red Robin as some of my favorite chains), but if I keep having experiences like this with the Cheesecake Factory, I might have to add them to the list. Maybe I just have to come to this location! Their cheesecakes are undeniable, and I now always go for their glamburgers. These two menu items for me have singled them out among the crowd. There is value based on the portion sizes and as noted by the prices I quoted above (total bill was around $54.00 before gift card and tip). The atmosphere is casual and family-oriented, but this particular location had the lighting set to more romantic mood, which is fine by me. Because of the dim lighting, I honestly don&amp;#39;t know how the d\u00e9cor is. Where we sat (close to the front window), it did feel a bit tight, but we made the most of it.

Sometimes you just feel like munching away on one of their many popular menu items. <br&gt;<br&gt;The portions here are pretty big, and most of the time I have to take what I am eating to go with me. Most of what I&amp;#39;ve tried here is pretty good, but I have a few favorites that I always return to. I really like the salads that they have here, and the portions are generous...I think my favorite would be the BBQ chicken salad but take a look at some of the other creative salads that they have to offer. Pasta dishes are another favorite of mine, and I like the Chicken Bellagio, the Cajun Jambalaya, and the Garlic Noodles with chicken. You can start of a meal with one of their many appetizers too, and my favorite is the Tex Mex Egg rolls. Like I said, since the portions are big, I never really have room for dessert here. Overall, I have found their food to be pretty consistent, which is good for any chain restaurant.<br&gt;<br&gt;I think the one thing that is inconsistent here is the service. On some days everyone is excellent from the hostess that greats you in the front to the waiter that takes care of you throughout your meal. However, in some cases, they are kind of lacking in customer service and really need training to learn to be more consistent to their customers. On my latest visit here, my sister went to the hostess, but they didn&amp;#39;t acknowledge her immediately because they were too involved with a personal conversation. When they seated us, our table was clearly missing a chair that we needed, and when I said something about this she had already run off, so I had to pull one for myself from another unoccupied table. Moments like this just take simple thought, and I&amp;#39;m surprised that something as easy as this went unacknowledged by the person who sat us at the table...totally unprofessional! The waiter that day was friendly, but could have been a bit more attentive give that there were not too many other guests dining at that time. Other times, the waiter service has been excellent here though.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ll probably come back to this location again, but I really hope that the service improves and doesn&amp;#39;t continue to decline over time.

It is very large but it is a sandwich that I can finish but when I do, it does not feel like I ate to much, I do not feel sick after eating it all. I usually get it with a salad and not fries and I like the fact that a salad is not extra than fries. I also like the Turkey Burger, the Sun-dried Tomato Fettuccine Pasta and pretty much all the salads. I also like that they have a fully-stocked bar where you can order anything off the menu. <br&gt;<br&gt;I also love the fact that The Cheesecake Factory now has a bar menu, or a small bite menu as they call it. One thing about The Cheesecake Factory is that the portions are huge, it is no wonder why Americans are so fat. <br&gt;<br&gt;I am a chocolate addict and I believe The Cheesecake Factory has two of the best chocolate desserts I have ever had. My favorite is the Godiva Cheesecake, which is basically Godiva in a cheesecake, need I say more? The other is a chocolate mousse cheesecake, the name says it all. <br&gt;<br&gt;Pretty much all The Cheesecake Factories are the same, however, the Beverly Hills location has always been a little better. I have always thought the service was always pleasant, the bartenders are always nice and frankly they are funny. Parking anywhere in Beverly Hills is a problem, however, the Cheesecake Factory has plenty of options. If you are lucky enough to grab a spot on Beverly Dr. or on a street located close to the resturauant, do it. There are also parking lots that are not far from the restaurant or you can valet at the restaurant but it costs around $10. <br&gt;<br&gt;One thing about the Cheesecake Factory that drives me insane is that they do not take reservations, at any location unless it is a weekend and you are in a large party. Sometimes people can wait two hours, something I would never do, but I think if you have customers routinely waiting that long, you need to accept reservations.

I don&amp;#39;t know if I caught everyone on a bad day but the hostess was very rude, didn&amp;#39;t look at me when she talked and ignored my question about where the restroom was. The server was even worse. She sat me in a crowded section of the restaurant when there were so many other available tables. She asked me to sit in the booth section of the table because I would be&amp;#34; in the way &amp;#34; of other guests. I ordered the chicken picata with extra sauce on the side, which she failed to bring me until I reminded her. She brought it to me at least 15 mins after the request and it was cold thus due to the wait my entire meal became cold. She didn&amp;#39;t ask \u00a0once if I needed a drink refill. When I got the check I asked for change and she brought me all large bills in return instead of singles. She failed to come back so after another 15mins of waiting I flagged down another server and got the adequate change for me to leave.

To say I am impressed with the cheesecake factory in Beverly Hills is an understatement, I can&amp;#39;t stop singing its praise. I dined in this place 6 months ago while on holiday in California. A lot of people think the cheesecake factory only perfect in cheesecakes, but the cheesecake factory boasts an impressive inventive menu selection ranging from old fashioned hamburgers, steaks, fish and seafood, mouth watering and filling salads to of course their famous addictive cheesecakes! They also have an impressive bar menu from mojitos to margaritas to martinis to wines. Your options really are unlimited. The food is perfect, comes well prepared and in large portions and oh ever so tasty but of course my favourite is their cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me creamy cheesecakes, from Godiva chocolate cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake, Dutch apple caramel steusel,pumpkin cheesecake coconut cheesecake..... I think you get the picture!! My mouth is beginning to water as I type this \u00a0Listen do yourself a favor.. If you ever go out to the USA for a visit, visit the local cheesecake factory in the state your are in( if there is none in the state you are in, place an order online ) and sample the true taste of fresh American cuisine and the best cheesecakes in the world.", "rating": 5, "date": "11/30/2008"}]}
