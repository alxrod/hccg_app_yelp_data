The lasagna was so loaded with oil that AFTER I drained it twice, it still pooled up in my dish AND I tried a couple of bites only to watch the grease ooze out as I cut into it. I stopped right there! My fiance ate part of his and wound up nauseous and is still paying for it today! <br&gt;<br&gt;How does Alex, the kitchen manager run a kitchen and allow such nastiness to leave his kitchen??!! (I had to demand the name of the kitchen manager so we&amp;#39;d all know who&amp;#39;d let such a grease laden lasagna leave his kitchen, to make people sick with) <br&gt;<br&gt;I thought this place was a 5 star restaurant according to the passengers I used to bring when I managed a limo service in fort Collins. I&amp;#39;m disgusted and think that the $53 we spent for two servings of lasagna and cheesecake should&amp;#39;ve been better than you can get at any craphole restaurant that serves it for $10!!. <br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had better lasagna at a hole in wall diner, for far less, with MUCH friendlier service. Whoever kept picking the phone up and print me back on hold without so much as an apology for the wait (actually sounded irritated that I was even making her answer the phone....) Rude, snobby, and obviously nothing close to what 5 star service signifies, and even at 2 stars, I&amp;#39;d expect my staff to provide better service than these 3 clowns did. I&amp;#39;ll NEVER recommend another person to them and when I hear how wonderful they are, I&amp;#39;ll be sure to dispute that. This was my first time ordering anything from them personally, and will be the last. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve left a message on the website and I&amp;#39;m only sharing this because after reading someone elses review warning of food poisoning recently, I would think the owners would reconsider what&amp;#39;s going on in their restaurant and hitting the streets. First off, Connor was an uppity little jerk on the phone who says &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;ll follow up and I agree that it shouldn&amp;#39;t have been like that BUT, you have to talk to doordash for the refund because we don&amp;#39;t refund for them but, if they give you a hard time I can reach out to them for you&amp;#34;. Nothing else besides how flippant attitude. <br&gt;<br&gt;REALLY??!! Since when should ANY other entity refund us for YOUR poor quality?! Regardless of policy, your manager could&amp;#39;ve been sincere, could&amp;#39;ve offered a personal follow up, could&amp;#39;ve offered a replacement, could&amp;#39;ve done 10x what he didn&amp;#39;t do at all. Personally, with what I&amp;#39;m seeing in your one star reviews and especially in the last few months..... There&amp;#39;d be new managers and staff, with clear understanding of how you run a business and deliver customer service. <br&gt;<br&gt;BTW, called doordash who said they&amp;#39;d refund half but after raising a little hell and sending them the pictures I took, they agreed to a full refund and was more sincere in their apology for your crap food than your own manager, Connor!! Who, by the way, didn&amp;#39;t bother to ask a name and for a phone number, nothing more than a snotty apology and a half interest in addressing the issue. Shame on you guys!! Maybe stick to cheesecake and let the real 5 star restaurants serve good food?! <br&gt;<br&gt;In business you often times only get one chance to make your business shine. You can thank your staff for tarnishing that opportunity. <br&gt;<br&gt;If Connor couldn&amp;#39;t handle the criticism and the fact that he had an upset customer who spent good, honest money on damned expensive lasagna, later at night and found themselves smacking from home and skipping dinner altogether because I didn&amp;#39;t want to eat at 11p.m. and go to bed right away..... Than maybe he&amp;#39;d do better flipping burgers at McDonald&amp;#39;s and letting a real manager take the heat. <br&gt;<br&gt;You&amp;#39;re damned lucky there wasn&amp;#39;t a hospital bill involved, we&amp;#39;d be having a much broader conversation. But, since doordash politely excused your disgusting food, refunded us in full, and no food poisoning happened, although we&amp;#39;re pretty ticked off that last night&amp;#39;s meal for my fiance that he could only stomach part of....is still bothering him today, we&amp;#39;ll move on and find a far better restaurant to support.

Let me start by exclaiming I would never in any circumstance choose to come to The Cheesecake Factory. This place was in high school one of those places highschool kids took their dates cause it looked classy (inside), and the food was decent (not great, but okay). <br&gt;<br&gt;My girlfriend while recently out of state tried another location, and found a dish she was recently impressed with, when she came back to CO she tried the dish at a local location on the 16th Street Mall in downtown Denver and was at that time equally satisfied. The dish I&amp;#39;m referring to is the hibachi steak, Wasabi mashed potatoes, with fried asparagus. <br&gt;<br&gt;We arrived at the 16th Street location around 430pm 10/30/16 and everything just seemed off from the moment we entered the building. To start the ladies waiting to seat people were off in the middle of the restaurant. So when you walk in you&amp;#39;re waiting for someone to ask you to be seated at the Desk right near the door, but no one is there, so you just wait. Then if the two ladies aren&amp;#39;t too busy talking to one another or looking down from the middle of the restaurant they FLAG you over, just to walk us back the direction we just came from to be seated. \u00a0(I saw two people standing there at the front door for so long they, and they were never approached about seating so they just walked out.)<br&gt;<br&gt;We order two plates... \u00a0Coullette steak (rare), mashed potatoes, and green beans (my plate). My girlfriend ordered her favorite, and literally the only reason for visiting this restaurant the Hibachi Steak (extra mushrooms) medium, Wasabi mashed potatoes, and fried asparagus (tempura). <br&gt;<br&gt;My plate comes and I immediately notice that my steak is medium to medium well (if you&amp;#39;re a steak lover, this is a major turnoff). Charred as hell on the outside. Mashed is fine, green beans are hard as rocks. Literally, how can you ruin a RARE steak I decide I&amp;#39;m starving, and don&amp;#39;t want to send it back as it seemed to take them forever to bring it in the first place (watched my girlfriend polish off the entire damn near basket of bread we were brought waiting for our meals.) I was so hungry I would have literally ate cardboard at this point.<br&gt;<br&gt; My girlfriend starts to dive into her meal, and notices that the steak she was given in her meal is mostly gristle and fat, she informs the waiter (Dan) and he proceeds to take the entire plate (not just the cruddy steak), we&amp;#39;ve both been starving while waiting for! Now, all of a sudden a complaint over the steak translates into take confiscate the entire dish... (Thanks Dan!) While she waited another 35 minutes or so for them to fix her another meal (I&amp;#39;m completely done with my food at this point!!!) supposed to be a different cut of steak from a different steak plate, but they were supposed to plate it the exact same way (Hibachi style, same sides).<br&gt;<br&gt; Didn&amp;#39;t really go down that way at all! We received a second server halfway through our meal named ****Stephen****, he was awesome, and offered to try and rectify the situation some (comp&amp;#39;d cheesecake, Thank you for that!), but between the long waits, bad food, and crappy service from the first waiter we were both over it. The manager had came initially and spoke to my girlfriend after the first plate was messed up, but basically encouraged her to just choose another plate &amp;#34;as he had no way of being able to tell the quality of the other steaks&amp;#34; for the meal (he had no idea, that this woman was not interested in anything else on their menu). <br&gt;<br&gt;The manager never revisited the table to see how the replacement meal turned out. I&amp;#39;ve had better service at Dennys from managers. The second steak was a better cut, but hardly had any mushrooms whatsoever(let alone extra as she had ordered originally), had no tempura asparagus, etc.<br&gt;<br&gt; Like when you have your appetite set for something in particular and they mess it up, you kinda just want to leave. We waited so long for our check to come we contemplated walking out of the restaurant at least 7 times. Stephen, later gave the issue back to Dan to fix cause I think he was wanting to get away from the issue.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m almost happy they ruined my girlfriends taste for this spot, maybe I will never have to come back to this God forsaken place again!!! I&amp;#39;m not sure if the kitchen was just off, or what the hell it was going on with the staff, etc. but people don&amp;#39;t want to pay their hard earned money for bullshit.

Service was slow at first but to be expected with how many people were in the restaurant. I can&amp;#39;t remember our servers name but he was fantastic. He also had a 14 top on our same section but it didn&amp;#39;t effect our service at all. We started off with drinks, I got a mojito and my lady had a martini. Then appetizers we got the lettuce tacos, crab cakes, and stuffed mushrooms! My girlfriend got the medallions and I had a filet. They were both amazing! I can&amp;#39;t express enough how much The Cheesecake Factory saved my night!

I confirmed that we could sit at a open tall top because it was cleaned off and with a horrible attitude she repeated herself then walked away from me. I understand it is open seating I am not stupid, I just wanted to make sure that table was available I did not deserve to be talked down to as she did to me, she should have given me a yes or no answer. We were then tossed between two different servers throughout the coarse of our meal and everything was lost in translation between the two of them. The waitress informed us that they did not have the meal my boyfriend ordered however, she waited half an hour after us ordering to tell us that. Almost an hour later our food finally arrived and the other waiter, Kameron, did not bring my friends food but instead asked him what he ordered then told him somebody else took it sorry. He offered to compensate him with a salad while he waited another half an hour to get a new meal. Amazing, a free $2 salad for a missing $25 meal. My friend told him he didn&amp;#39;t want the food because he was very upset and did not want to wait even longer. The waiter ended up still charging my friend for his beer and did not even offer genuine condolences on ruining the evening for us. The waiter also never offered water refills, we had to flag him down for more water at the end of our meals when we could finally find him. Side note- their drink menus do not have pricing so do not be surprised when you get charged $11 for a half a cups worth of a margarita.

As I could have whipped up an amazing concoction if I had the materials necessary)... But that&amp;#39;s beside the point. Anyway, the first thing we noticed about this dish was that it was not typical of a Cheesecake Factory portion. Normally when I go to Cheesecake, I can leave with more than enough food for two people. Not this time. The next thing we noticed was that our pasta showed up cold. Like really cold. This is one thing I can forgive, as I made the decision to order delivery. However, the chicken was stale, the noodles were barely cooked, and the sauce was non-existent. This pasta, as a born-and-bred Italian, made me want to give up pasta forever and become a leaf-eating vegan.<br&gt;<br&gt;Because I know that this stuff *happens*, I&amp;#39;m going to give Cheesecake another chance to wow me.

The restaurant itself looks good, servers have quite slow service and response. Food is ok. <br&gt;Here is the real bad thing that happened to me tonight which convinced me to write this such bad experience. After finished my meal, I provided 2 gift cards as I bought from this exact restaurant location at the end of last year to pay for the meal. Ten minutes after I checked, the server came back and informed me that one of the two cards didn&amp;#39;t go through. I showed her that I just checked the gift card balance at their cashier just right before I got seated (I also provide her the paper that I received as an evidence of gift card balance checking which was clearly stated everything they need to know to prove that I really had that amount until the server took my card for check). The server then left my table again (about 10 minutes) and came back with acted manager. The manager told me that after he tried every single way to check my gift card on their computer, it still came out that this gift card cannot be used because it had 0 balance in it. He also asked me (not very polite manner) whether I used it after I had checked the balance at their cashier. Wait!? Is that what the manager of the well-known restaurant should ask their customers? It&amp;#39;s like I knew that I have already used that card and I still used it to pay for the food. Come on! even little child knows what should he do in this situation. The manager still tried to find out if I misunderstood or I lied by trying to check the balance of the gift card online. Absolutely, he couldn&amp;#39;t find anything but the balance was zero. I spend almost 30 minutes at that time to wait for the checked out process and that made me missed the bus to my home. I then tried to figure out by myself that what&amp;#39;s really happen to me. So, the first thing I did is to call the gift card department. The gift card representative informed me that the gift card had been charged for the left amount during the period of time that the server brought my card to check. I let the GC representative talked to the manager. Thank god that he didn&amp;#39;t accuse me whether that was the real cheesecake factory gift card representative. The truth came up that I told the truth even I didn&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s really happen to the charging process, I guess it&amp;#39;s because of their system or human error.

But it&amp;#39;s whatever. \u00a0The service was ok, nothing extraordinary. \u00a0All in all, I will not let this experience ruin my fondness for The Cheesecake Factory. \u00a0I just won&amp;#39;t come back to this location and hope that the one in Park Meadow&amp;#39;s offers something a little bit better.", "rating": 2, "date": "3/3/2012"}, {"text": "I love going here with my friends. Just to relax and have a good lunch/dinner follow by a yummy piece of strawberry cheese cake. I love their chop salad here. It is huge so you need atleast 4 people to share it with. My favorite here is their steak with shitaki mushrooms. Overall, their food is good, portion is humongous and priced right. <br&gt;Their cheesecake is to die for. I love their orginal cheesecake with fresh strawberries. They have many other cheesecake flavors to choose from.", "rating": 4, "date": "12/4/2010"}, {"text": "I must spread the word about the wretched Cheesecake Factory. I gave one star, but honestly it should be a negative one star. I had such a bad experience, it was surreal. I went to a semi-late Saturday dinner around 9 with a girlfriend, they told us the wait would be 20 minutes but it was closer to half an hour. I could be forgiving about that, right? Then we were led to the back of the restaurant in this strange gold enclosure in the middle of the dining room. Whether this was intentional or not is anyones guess, but my girlfriend and I immediately noticed that the only other table within the enclosure was a group of African American people. My girlfriend and I are Hispanic. We looked around, as far as the eyes could see were the Aryan customers of The Cheesecake Factory. Coincidence, or did the white hostess subconsciously lead the obvious minorities to an enclosed area? Also, I could forgive that, possible coincidence. Next, we waited nearly 20 minutes for water, our server was an arrogant turd that suggest the fire-roasted artichoke to my friend, (what arrived was the hard outer husk of a burnt artichoke), then after we complained gently about the artichoke he told us quote, &amp;#34;Oh, that&amp;#39;s because they aren&amp;#39;t in season.&amp;#34; WTF, then why suggest it in the first place? The entree arrived, and their fettuccine alfredo is ridiculously bland. Our waiter had apparently disappeared so we tagged another server and requested the manager. The manager arrived, kept interrupting our POLITE complaints and actually abruptly left before I had finished thanking him for comping the food! My friend and I left at nearly 10 at night, still hungry, and in a huff about the horrific, possibly racist, incredibly bad service and food at the Cheesecake Factory.", "rating": 1, "date": "1/16/2008"}, {"text": "In a town FULL of exceptional local eateries, it is simply a waste of time, money and tastebuds to eat here. I&amp;#39;m not a fan of chains for the exact reasons this place exemplifies! Overly large portions of butter and salt, a lack of creativity and maudlin servers who are only thinking of when their shift ends. Unfortunately, my daughter chose The CCF for her birthday lunch spot since her favorite restaurant was closed. Although she relished the monstrosity of a cheesecake slice she was given, I was unimpressed by the slow service and bored expression in our servers face, even when I asked if we could do something special for her birthday. My shrimp pasta dish was nearly coagulating in butter sauce and the shrimp were tough. The overly-descriptive and novel-esqe menu may promise great expectations...but it&amp;#39;s all window dressing.

As one who is in the service industry in the downtown area, I know what to expect for the type of crowds at various places, and am always excited to support local business. Going to a corporate chain however, always leaves me with an experience I could have done without. This last visit was the perfect example of why I dislike anything corporate. It leaves very little to the imagination, and MUCH to be desired. I have always loved dessert here, and was excited to have my favorite chocolate tuxedo cheesecake.<br&gt;We started off here for a friends birthday dinner. She had called earlier in the day to reserve a table for 12, which they didn&amp;#39;t do because &amp;#34;we wouldn&amp;#39;t need a reservation. Just come on in!&amp;#34; This was just the beginning. We bellied up to a busy Thursday, and a 50 minute wait for a table. As we gathered round the bar, service was decent. I was unimpressed by the liquor selections and all I found was a list of over sugared concoctions, and even less to be admired with in the liquor department. A beer was sufficient. Our bartenders however, were pleasant and kept our group occupied and happy. <br&gt;When we DID get our table, our waitress was pleasant, but did take 20 minutes to get just water on the table (1st priority in my book), and when I ordered a vodka press, had no clue what it was. Really???? Ok, so lack of knowledge doesn&amp;#39;t make her a bad person, but in this industry, it&amp;#39;s ALL about your service knowledge! So another 10 or so minutes goes by before cocktails hit the table, and sadly enough some drinks were even forgotten. When we tell her that we want separate checks to avoid a hassle later, she says she will split them later (Oh, boy). So we finally ordered, (after reading our novel of a menu), and all seems to be picking up. What saddened me is the amount of staff running amok, looking miserable, and clearly not doing much for one another. Even the obvious floor manager passed our table with empty waters, bread baskets and cocktail glasses without as much as a 2nd thought or offering to help his staff in clearing as something as simple as an empty glass or 2. When our food did finally arrive, it literally came out 2 plates at a time, since our waitress clearly had not much support staff to back her up, save for the one gentleman who helped her with 2 plates. I wish I had our server&amp;#39;s name, because she was nice, but really...after waiting almost an hour for our table, and waiting for things to pick up to a relatively decent pace, things just never got past so-so. When I went to make change at the bar to pay my bill, another server was more perceptive in the 1 minute at the bar, than any other service we had all night. If I had thought that the manger seemed concerned, I may have asked to speak with him. Oh and adding 18 % gratuity to a table that you give virtually no service to, hardly constitutes as acceptable. Had you given proper service and attention to begin with, you would have received a hell of a lot more from a group who eats, sleeps and breathes in Denver&amp;#39;s nightlife. Thanks for bagging our food to go, but with portions like that, it&amp;#39;s probably pretty routine.<br&gt;<br&gt;Long story short, spending 3 hours here just to get over-sized portions of mediocre food, left none of us wanting dessert, which was the main reason we came in the 1st place. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that unless I get cheesecake to go, or have to attend another event here, I won&amp;#39;t be spending any more time here.", "rating": 1, "date": "7/13/2010"}, {"text": "I went with three friends on Saturday, March 15 for lunch. The place was packed and there were a lot of people out celebrating St. Patrick&amp;#39;s Day that weekend. We arrived a little after noon and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. The restaurant does this thing where they ring the little buzzer, but you&amp;#39;re left waiting another 10 minutes to be seated. I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s due to lack of menus, or if it&amp;#39;s a sneaky ploy to make you wait longer. We were seated and the two tables next to us (both seated after us) got served and got their food sooner than us. We waited forever, and finally our food came. Much to our disappointment, two of the dishes (neither of them mine) had HAIR in them. Disgusting. We told the server, who was just a terrible server and never checked on us - we had to flag her down - who proceeded to get her manager. The manager was a dingbat who said, &amp;#34;I heard there was hair in your dish!&amp;#34; to one of my friends. Sure as sh*t, my friend pulled out this long ass hair from her food. Disgusting. My other friend spoke up and said, &amp;#34;Yeah there was hair in mine as well.&amp;#34; The manager completely ignored her, and said &amp;#34;We&amp;#39;ll take your meal off&amp;#34; to the first friend. Anyway, by this time it&amp;#39;s around 2:00 and needed to pay and get out of there. So there were three checks for a total of $41 and some change. One was paid with a $20, the second was paid with a $20, and the third was paid with a card. I marked on the bill which meal went with which form of payment. Then we explained it to our server when she came to collect the bill. She totally screwed it up and took all of the cash and put $1.41 on the card.....OMG. By this time, we were livid because we had been there for so long and it was just mistake after mistake. The server fixed the checks, and my friend who was ignored by the manager went up to her and told her that our dining experience was godawful. Then we got the hell outta there. The worst dining experience I&amp;#39;ve had in a looooooooong time. I understand when things get busy and people are working really hard....I&amp;#39;ve worked in several restaurants, and I know the stress. But this was beyond unacceptable. A 2.5 hour ordeal that was disastrous the entire time.
