It had dishes from all continents, a bar, and those awesome creamy sweet cool desserts. Perfect cure for indecisiveness. We drove to Willow Grove in about 30. The expansive hall was busy but not full. We were seated immediately near the bar.<br&gt;<br&gt;We caught the final minutes of happy hour and celebrated with half price glasses of an excellent cabernet. We selected the Crispy Brussel Sprouts for an appetizer (wonderfully done with bacon and maple syrup), and their Southwest Chicken Sandwich (strong contender in a crunchy baguette and spicy aioli), and Shepherd&amp;#39;s Pie (savory ground beef and veggies in mushroom gravy topped with a load of mashed potatoes and melted cheese). Toasting our way through the meal, we completed with a flourish of a thick slice of shared almond cheesecake (they bake them right). <br&gt;<br&gt;This was a full and fun dinner that permitted us to chose cravings that we didn&amp;#39;t know we had.

I&amp;#39;m glad we tried it, but I don&amp;#39;t know of I&amp;#39;d get it again because of the price. I got the lunch sized portion of the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. Even the lunch sized portion was so much I had to take some home. It was the most \u00a0delectable pasta dish I have ever eaten. It had the fresh bite of peas, black pepper seasoned chicken, savory mushrooms, juicy tomatoes, and salty panchetta. The flavors melded together amazingly. My boyfriend got the marsala chicken. Pricy, but a good portion size for the price. They used bowtie noodles and breaded chicken for this dish. He said the wine sauce was cooked perfectly, and the overall taste was tangy. He said the dish could&amp;#39;ve used more sauce in general, and the chicken was cut pretty thin, if that is something that bothers you. For dessert, I had the caramel pecan turtle cheesecake. Yummmmmmmy. A pecan brownie topped with caramel cheesecake, caramel turtle pecan topping, and a fudgy swirl. This is one of the best desserts I have ever eaten. My boyfriend got the Hershey&amp;#39;s Chocolate Bar cheesecake. He said there was plenty of chocolate, very sweet, and the whipped cream was real and not artificial tasting.

This wasn&amp;#39;t our first time, so we know the drill here. I have also been a server for three different restaurants, so again, I know the drill. <br&gt;<br&gt;We waited about 35 mins to be seated, but that&amp;#39;s expected here. Once we were seated, our server, Geraldine, came to say she&amp;#39;ll be right back. 20 minutes later she finally came back, didn&amp;#39;t introduce herself and then took our order. We got 3 apps, the first came after 20 minutes. 15 minutes later we were still waiting for our two other apps. They finally came and we&amp;#39;re good. We finished our apps around 8 (at this point I was paying close attention to the time. <br&gt;<br&gt;8:30 our food finally comes. My cheese was crusty on the burger, the onions were shriveled and there were two random sauces on the burger. There should have only been one sauce. I ordered sweet potato fries and got regular, AND they were cold. We sat for about 10 minutes waiting for Geraldine to come check on us. Meanwhile my boyfriends burger was getting cold. By the way, his was missing sauce and he didn&amp;#39;t get a sauce on the side he asked for. She finally came and I asked for the manager. He came, and handled the situation really well. Although I wish I could say he saved the night, after 2 hours there, our night was disappointing. His name was Bryan or Ryan (not 100% sure what he said). So he brings us the check and we wait for Geraldine to come grab it. Once again we were waiting for 10 minutes and finally just got up to YET AGAIN find the manager to complete our payment. We could have just not paid and left. It didn&amp;#39;t seem like Geraldine would have even known.<br&gt;<br&gt;I want to add that both tables surrounding us had a problem with their service as well. Table to our left hadn&amp;#39;t gotten drinks for a good 30 minutes and the table to the right didn&amp;#39;t get their cheesecakes for at least 35 minutes. I don&amp;#39;t know if Geraldine was having a bad night or what, but I wasn&amp;#39;t paying $100.00+ for this kind of service. I really got the impression that she was newer and was getting flustered and overwhelmed. Although it was 7:30 on a Sunday.. <br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, service was terrible and it seemed the kitchen was off too with all the odd sauces or lack thereof I should say. I would definitely prefer to go to the KOP location next time.<br&gt;<br&gt;After we finished our first appetizer, we wanted to make room on the table for the next two apps. When Geraldine came to drop off the two plates I asked her if she could take the empty plate (which was sitting there. Ever heard of pre-bussing?) from the first appetizer to make room. She took the tray and started walking away, then turned around and I kid you not she said to my boyfriend &amp;#34;Wait actually can you hold this while I get something for them?&amp;#34;. I promise you she handed the plate BACK to my boyfriend and she walked to another table to give them &amp;#34;something&amp;#34;. The kicker? SHE NEVER CAME BACK FOR THAT PLATE!

I&amp;#39;ll start with the good; the food was (mostly) delicious. I had their loaded nachos (don&amp;#39;t remember the menu name), which consisted of thick nachos that seemed to be fried on premises. I also had the chicken samosas, which were awesome, and while not completely authentic, they had a nice curry flavor that was palatable for American taste buds but still distinctly tasted like an Indian masala. Also, their cheesecake is obviously quite good. I had some of their new s&amp;#39;more edition and it lived up to the hype. Also, I tend to like the decor inside, even if it is quite dark.<br&gt;<br&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the cons. My house salad was disgusting - the salad itself was wilted and the vinaigrette they put on it only served to make the aging leaves even more bitter. Luckily, this was the only bad item anyone got and the rest of our food was edible. Worse than this, is that the staff, particularly hostesses, are very rude. They seemed angry we had a large group, and gave us poor accommodations so that one person had to sit on a rickety chair in the middle of the aisle. Also our waitress seemed over worked and barely checked on us, so sadly I personally will refrain from ever going there on a Saturday again, as the attitude was too much.<br&gt;<br&gt;For being a chain, it&amp;#39;s not bad.

My sister had a kale and quinoa salad, and my mom ordered a turkey sandwich off the &amp;#34;skinny menu.&amp;#34; I was pretty happy with my choice; as a shareable appetizer, it was actually a lot for one person. The three sauces were delicious and so flavorful. The vegetables were fresh, and the red cabbage was particularly delicious since it&amp;#39;s usually so tough in texture. Unfortunately, the texture of the noodles was not good--they weren&amp;#39;t chewy at all.

Actually, one of my favorite restaurants period.<br&gt;<br&gt;First off, Cheesecake Factory has literally the biggest menu I&amp;#39;ve ever seen. To get to the salads, you have to go to somewhere around page 15! Normally, I&amp;#39;d see too menu menu options as a restaurant not knowing what it is, and just throwing everything on a page with a total disregard for quality of the product, not here. Everything I have had here has been nothing less than great. My usual order is the Crispy Chicken Costoletta which is basically a lightly breaded chicken in a lemon sauce, served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The chicken is divine, and the lemon sauce makes it perfect. Portion size is also huge, I am either beyond full if I finish it, or usually have another meal to take home. The mashed potatoes are good, but nothing to go crazy over. Recently, I&amp;#39;ve been splitting a bunch of appetizers with my friends, tapas style. For appetizers, I&amp;#39;d highly recommend the Tex Mex Eggrolls, Fried Macaroni and Cheese, and the Crispy Taquitos. All are phenomenal. The ones I am not the biggest fan of it the Spinach and Cheese dip (the spinach is flavorless and the cheese is just put on top), and the Quesadilla (chicken just tastes bland and processed). <br&gt;<br&gt;The cheesecake deserves its own little section for just how good it is. Caution, the cheesecake is on the pricy side, I&amp;#39;d be much happier if it was a little bit cheaper. Nevertheless, they are all phenomenal. My favorite is Adam&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, but most of the other ones I&amp;#39;ve had are equally as great. My only recommendation to Cheesecake Factory would be to setup a dessert to sample a bunch of different cheesecakes, instead of paying the price to buy a bunch of them. If this exists already, shame on me for not finding it, but if it doesn&amp;#39;t it needs to in order to taste the bliss of all these cheesecakes at once!<br&gt;<br&gt;Atmosphere here is always very nice, and plenty of room in the booths.

It wasn&amp;#39;t until 8pm that we were finally seated.<br&gt;<br&gt;Service was fine getting our drinks out in a timely manner. However, when the bread and butter was brought out, we still had no silverware at our table. After waiting a few minutes unnoticed, we pulled a waitress aside and asked for silverware/table settings. No one had even noticed that we were without table settings.<br&gt;<br&gt;5 minutes later, a waiter/busboy(?), came out and plopped two napkins full of silverware at one end of the table and left. No settings were placed, an no one followed up with us. <br&gt;<br&gt;I have never felt so disrespected at a restaurant. Honestly, Chick Fil-A gives me better service than this.<br&gt;<br&gt;It is now 8:42pm and our entrees have just come out.

It over shadowed the Ruby Tuesday&amp;#39;s a few doors down. There is a nice sized patio with heat lamps and street lamp lighting. Upon walking through the doors you first notice the high vaulted ceilings. It took everything I had not to scream Hello, just so I could hear my echo. One reviewer said they were 30 feet high. The next claimed them to be 40 feet high. I am going to jump out on a limb and say they were 52 and 1/2 feet high. <br&gt;<br&gt;The floors are of limestone and the upholstered cherry wood high booths claim some privacy. The lighting is very contemporary with amber shades on the walls and tapestry skylights. Huge columns are scattered about with amber shades of light glowing. <br&gt;<br&gt;To the right is a massive sized, glass encased counter with more cheesecake than one could ever dream about. Straight in front of you is the hostess desk. To your left is the large open dining room and the very small, yet decorative bar. Get there early to secure a stool. The lounge area has high top tables with stools. <br&gt;<br&gt;A little Cheesecake Factory History: <br&gt;<br&gt;There are over 161 Restaurants with over 50 kinds of cheesecakes. The Grand Lux Cafe is a subsidiary of theirs. The CCF was the first restaurant chain to reach a billion dollars in revenues with fewer than 100 restaurants in operation. The first CCF was opened in Beverly Hills, Ca. in 1978. Evelyn Overton sold her first Cheesecake in 1949. She baked them in her basement for restaurants and her husband Oscar handled the sales. They then opened a small shop in their home town of Detroit, Michigan. After her children were grown and gone, she and her husband moved to Los Angeles. The rest is history. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our Experience: BYOF <br&gt;<br&gt;Our server was very friendly and informative and greeted us almost immediately. Since there are over 200 items on this menu, It was like reading a textbook. She was patient with my needing to read every item. With all to choose from, we probably ordered all wrong. I started with the Baked Potato Soup. It was loaded with veggies, cheese and bacon. It was on the brownish side and tasted old and burned. We shared Fried Zucchini as an appetizer. They were your typical frozen and fried zucchini, nothing special. The ranch dressing that was served with it was unbelievably sweet. It did not compliment the zucchini at all. Hubby had a Cheese Burger, $10.95 and said wow when he first got it. He was not thrilled once he started eating it. The patties were preformed and frozen prior to cooking. With the burger came a large amount of ice cold shoestring fries. I ordered a MR Filet. \u00a0It took so long, I knew it would be over cooked and hubby and I both think the server knew too. I cut into it and it was MW. Goofy looking Filet too, flat and almost as big as the plate?! She took it back and brought me the MR. I must say it was flavorful and tender. I opted for Mac &amp;amp; Cheese as my side. I know, I am so silly. The Mac &amp;amp; Cheese was one step up from Kraft. When she presented the check, she had taken the Filet off. Portions are large, prices are as high as their ceiling. The Filet was $34.95 and I am not at Ruths&amp;#39; Chris! We took our piece of Key Lime Cheesecake and Carrot Cake home. The desserts are very good and I would consider using take out for desserts only. They also ship Cheesecakes via Federal Express.<br&gt;<br&gt;Three managers sat together at a high top table in the Lounge. \u00a0One young attractive server entertained them the entire time of our visit. \u00a0Not once did I see a manager get up to greet or check on a table. \u00a0All three were very young and I am sure there for the easy paycheck. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;If and when I ever receive $50.00 in Gift Cards for the CCF again, I will order Cheesecakes to go. That is how they started. That is what they specialize in and they do know how to do it right. <br&gt;<br&gt;As for the 200 menu items, it is a chain, what did you expect?

This is more like a dance club. <br&gt;The service was pretty good. The place wasn&amp;#39;t crowded, but was active. The prices were pretty high, but the amount of food they give you is beyond eatable in one sitting. Not sure if eatable is a word, but I think you get my meaning. <br&gt;Seems weird, but the menus were very difficult to read. Not the print or design, but the advertisements and order. Every time you turned a page, you saw a listing of food and a full page add for something. Jewelry, cars, whatever. I found that tacky. Combined with the overdone decor, It wasn&amp;#39;t my favorite atmosphere. But no big, to food was good. Except for the burger. My daughter ordered the Fun burger, which sounded fun. Actually, it&amp;#39;s just a big mac, but looked really good. Unfortunately, they didn&amp;#39;t cook it enough, and my stomach was turning all night.

I was there for my aunt&amp;#39;s bday party with my \u00a0last Friday night which is typically an extremely busy night for any restaurant. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful to our party. I will start by saying that my aunt is bound to a wheel chair, they were helpful in making sure our family was seated in area with enough space for her and her wheelchair, moving tables and chairs to do so. Our party was also pretty large, about 15 ppl, and they were extremely helpful and accommodating with that as well. One of my cousins brought along her 2 toddler age children, who broke a plate halfway through dinner and made a mess. The staff cleaned the mess up quickly and with no attitude and were so nice to the kids during the process. Any requests that we made were quickly and accurately fulfilled for us! I don&amp;#39;t usually write yelp reviews but felt extremely inclined to do so after this fantastic service that helped to make my aunts birthday extra special!

Now upon looking at the menu, it is a large selection and all the food choices looks good. Even for those who want a healthy/low cal meal can have enjoy this place. The size of the entrees are huge but also that the prices are higher so this is a good deal. Don&amp;#39;t order too much apps because you must save room for their delish cheesecake.
