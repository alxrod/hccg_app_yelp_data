However this location my food was beyond excellent. I&amp;#39;ve never had anything from Cheesecake Factory that was outstanding. Nothing bad but nothing to remember until this particular visit I had the chicken Marsala and it was fantastic!! Taste, quality and quantity! I was very pleased and will actually return again soon and look forward to it. <br&gt;This location is attached to a mall so during busy shopping days plan to possibly walk a bit or enter the mall through a less busy entrance however having mall parking lot available does mean ample parking.

Came to the Cheesecake Factory for a graduation celebration. We made 3 different reservations \u00a0because of the COVID rules and restrictions. \u00a0These reservations was made a week and a half prior to our \u00a0visit August 8th, 2020. 11am that day received a call from a representative from the establishment to confirm reservations and explained that 3 different reservations were made and that we understood that only 6 people could sit at a table which was fine our only request was if each table could be in the same area. We were told that was ok. Fast forward to 7:30 our reservation time. We were told our table wasn&amp;#39;t ready 17 people waited outside in the heat for an hour or more just to be told that only one table was ready and the other two wasn&amp;#39;t ready yet. At this point we are livid because we were not only told by a representative that all table would be in the same area but what was the point of making a reservation when you still have to wait an hour after you left designated time. I talk to manager on duty Corey and he shows me a section in the outside mall area and as I told him we didn&amp;#39;t care where we sit as long as we are all in the same section. So the problem was clearly identified as a communication problem with the employees. From the girl at the door and hostess who never communicated our concern with manager initially. Then we got our food and the food was terrible and I know for a fact the dish I always order from the Cheesecake Factory is delicious which is the Louisiana chicken pasta. This establishment needs to be revamped from the top up. They are running it how they want to. STEER CLEAR PEOPLE they are terrible .

Pricey. Made from scratch? Is it really a factory? <br&gt;<br&gt;I had to come check out all this hype. I&amp;#39;d heard the menu was extensive, so I wanted to check it out online first. The online menu doesn&amp;#39;t seem to work really well with an android mobile. I could read a partial description for each item, and see a camera icon, but whenever I&amp;#39;d click on these, it would take me in a circle back to the start again. Also, I couldn&amp;#39;t find any prices at all on the online menu.<br&gt;<br&gt;Price is a determining factor in making a menu choice. Remember in Slingblade, Carl wanted to know if they had French fried potatoes? Then he asked how much do you want for them? Only then was he able to make a decision to buy some of the bigguns. Without that information, I cannot make a smart choice. <br&gt;<br&gt;We walked in and were in awe of our surroundings. It&amp;#39;s a big place, modern, and fancy. Of course, you see the dessert counter as soon as you walk in. We arrived at 1:00 Tuesday afternoon to avoid the crowd, were seated right away, and had excellent service.<br&gt;<br&gt;The menu is massive. We all came for a small lunch with dessert. I normally don&amp;#39;t eat sweets, but I like cheesecake occasionally, and that&amp;#39;s what I came for. I noticed the menu does not list prices for beer and most of the desserts. I also noticed it doesn&amp;#39;t say the size of the pizza. It still wasn&amp;#39;t easy to make a smart choice. I was hoping the lunch menu would have something in store for me, but even the lunch specials ranged from $11.00 to $14.50. I know it&amp;#39;s a nice place, but this is pricey. $3.00 for a glass of tea? Why? Chicken biscuits were $17.00 if I remember correctly! I don&amp;#39;t want a complete meal, and I don&amp;#39;t want to spend everything I have. Also, the menu is so large, that it takes a lot of research to select something.<br&gt;<br&gt;The honey wheat bread was good. The sour dough was so tough it was hard to eat. The butter was too cold to spread. The crab artichoke dip was good, but the bread was extra tough. Crab balls, Greek salad, Asian lettuce wraps were just ok. The desserts and milkshakes were excellent. We asked what kind of ice cream the shake was made from, and the waitress said it just comes in on a big truck. Hmm. Not made from scratch.<br&gt;<br&gt;We asked the server if she gets to take food home. She said they don&amp;#39;t allow employees to take food home and they throw all the extras in the dumpster every night. Funny, the website says under fun facts under FAQ, that they donate all of the extra food to feed hungry people through Harvest.<br&gt;<br&gt;She said they make all the cheesecake daily. Funny, the website doesn&amp;#39;t say that. Everything I could find online says the cheesecake is trucked in frozen. Not really a factory is it? More of a restaurant that buys from a factory. I can get frozen cheesecake from the grocery. <br&gt;<br&gt;Beef? What is American style Kobe? Kobe must come from Japan, period. There&amp;#39;s no such thing as American Kobe. What they are selling is Wagyu. Some of the steaks are labeled as premium certified black Angus. Are we talking prime, select, choice? Are they aged? Some steaks are USDA branded, but again there are no descriptions beyond that. An educated diner knows this doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean that they offer a superior beef product. <br&gt;<br&gt;What does it mean that your fish are line caught when possible? Is this supposed to enhance the perception of quality? How does the customer know when it was possible? I always thought long lines were dangerous to birds.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m always skeptical of the marketing phrase \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&amp;#34;made from scratch&amp;#34;, \u00a0especially when it is used vaguely. &amp;#34;Made from scratch&amp;#34; comes from sports and means to start off without an advantage. The menu is not specific enough to make it mean anything at all. Do they grind flour? Do they make fresh pasta? Do they make their cheesecake from cream cheese, or do they make the cream cheese?

While the bread was in its usual basket, the butter was served to us in a dirty dish, &amp;amp; it was just a thick square block. In Hawaii, the butter is wrapped individually which I feel is more sanitary.<br&gt;We started with the crab dip appetizer which was so bad, we had them take it back. The crab dip itself was bad, and the bread it was served with was stale.<br&gt;On top of that, our entrees were just plain bad. I ordered what I usually do-the chicken costoletta. There was no lemon zest, which it usually has (look up pictures) &amp;amp; it lacked flavor. It&amp;#39;s like they breaded the chicken completely plain..no salt or anything. My husband&amp;#39;s meal was worse-he got the jambalaya, and the pasta all stuck together in one huge ball! Also, when he asked to have cheese for his pasta, our waiter didn&amp;#39;t even know where the block was. When she found it, she handled it with a freaking napkin!

It was an experience that will not soon be forgotten. The service was good and the food was wonderful. However, while waiting to order dessert, I observed a fight through the windows. Multiple individuals were fighting inside of the mall, just outside of The Cheesecake Factory. Security showed up and began forcing those involved outside. As they exited the mall (just feet from The Cheesecake Factory), approximately 8 gun shots rang out. I immediately grabbed my family and we got under the table, as did the entire restaurant. Realizing my oldest daughter (10) was in the restroom, I made my way through turned over chairs and other patrons on the floor to get to her. Once the scene appeared to be clear, I brought my daughter out of the restroom and back to the table. We continued sitting there, as multiple police cars arrived outside. I then observed police officers walking around the entrance and inside of the mall, with AR15 rifles. Just when we thought everything was under control, the officers with the riffles began running back toward the entrance where the shooting occurred. People in The Cheesecake Factory once again began screaming and got under their tables. After another few minutes of uncertainty, people began emerging from their hiding spots. Moments later, a female was taken out of the mall on a stretcher, by paramedics. We waited until it seemed as if everything had calmed down, and we paid our bill. On our way out, we observed an individual who had been shot. He was sitting handcuffed on the sidewalk surrounded by police, and was receiving medical attention. <br&gt;<br&gt;Can I put the blame on The Cheesecake Factory? Yes, they knew the area has been declining and still chose it for their location. There are safer areas nearby that could have benefited from this business. <br&gt;<br&gt;Additionally, it The Cheesecake Factory has any plan for an active shooter situation, it was not acted upon. The shooting happened just outside of the windows behind the cheesecake viewing area, yet the restaurant never went on lock down mode. Instead, customers were left to fend for themselves and seek their own hiding places. Also, the doors were never locked; therefore, the shooters could have easily entered the business. <br&gt;<br&gt;As stated before, this was my five year old daughter&amp;#39;s birthday dinner, in which she and her other sisters (6 &amp;amp; 10) were forced to hide under tables and brought to tears. She later woke up with nightmares, asking if there were any &amp;#34;bad men&amp;#34; outside.

I shouldn&amp;#39;t be asked if I want more water, when my food hasn&amp;#39;t even made it to the table yet. It&amp;#39;s just common sense. 2.) Servers not knowing their table numbers.

I sat there for awhile waiting on my spinach and a knife to cut my steak with. 3) Lack of management involvement. My boyfriends&amp;#39; chicken was undercooked, so we waited and waited for the recook. Our sever asked if he wanted it to go since I would probably be done with my food.. If we wanted it TO GO, we would have went through TO GO. He even mentioned how the manager would come to the table and we never saw a manager. We never even noticed managers going to tables and checking on anyone. We DID notice managers standing around, doing nothing.

I guess the cooks are not aware that citric acid and milk don&amp;#39;t mix unless your making cheese!<br&gt;<br&gt;We came home with a cheesecake that I thought would be their saving grace (being the name of the place and all). However, it was half frozen and has freezer burn on the top and sides. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you have to eat there the beet and goat cheese salad was fresh and pleasant.

Because either I live in a parallel universe and have been to a completely different restaurant than everyone else or there are a few people on here that are just naturally unhappy people. But going through their reviews it seems like all they do is complain. (I wonder if they ever thought the problem might be with them, constantly getting shitty service everywhere you go? Maybe you should be less of snobby bitch and servers will be nice to you.)<br&gt;<br&gt;I have been here approximately a dozen times since its opening. Including training night. Each time I go the hostess staff always makes good conversation with me and most of them remember me from the previous time. Wait times are never unreasonable unless you go during the lunch or dinner rush but that&amp;#39;s to be expected. (Unless you&amp;#39;re the type of person that complains about traffic during rush hour, but common sense can&amp;#39;t be taught so there&amp;#39;s not much anyone can do to help you, yet alone any managers) <br&gt;<br&gt;I have both sat at the bar for service and gotten tables. There have been times when service was less then spectacular. But these times usually coincide with dining during the busiest times and most of the mistakes were done by the kitchen not my server. When I brought it up to the server she apologized and had my meal remade and expedited. She even went as far as having a manager comp it off my tab. (The things that happen when you&amp;#39;re a polite human being and recognize that mistakes happen and you don&amp;#39;t have to be a flying douche every time something goes wrong). Even when service was lacking, I once politely informed out server that she had forgotten a condiment request, when she apologized I told her I recognized she&amp;#39;s covering a very large section of the restaurant and that I understand how it could have slipped her mind and to hang in there. You&amp;#39;ll never guess what happened! She brought us a free slice of cheese cake for being understanding. (Again, don&amp;#39;t act like a douche canoe and treat people like humans and they&amp;#39;ll take care of you) <br&gt;<br&gt;As far as the bar goes, only once have I gone to the bar where the bartender recognized me, although they do seem to have a large rotating bar staff so that&amp;#39;s understandable. When the bartenders are busy tending the bar and other customers (you know their job?) all it took was for me to open my mouth (that collection of muscles in front of your teeth and contains your tongue) and ask for a drink and service. Low and behold! They came over to help me! I didn&amp;#39;t have to sit 10 mins in passive aggressive silence waiting for them to notice me while attending to 20 other people. <br&gt;<br&gt;As far as the food goes, portions are large unless you&amp;#39;re super fat or have a diet of 6000 calories a day be prepared to have left overs or share a meal. Prices are high, it&amp;#39;s a fine dining restaurant, that&amp;#39;s to be expected. You don&amp;#39;t go into dillard&amp;#39;s and expect to pay Walmart prices do you?

Against my better judgement, I ignored the reviews about this particular location. I consider myself to be a foodie, and dine out often. This was the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. <br&gt;<br&gt;Strike 1 - While being seated, I saw an empty booth and asked if I could have that table, the host told me no. I understand the &amp;#34;rotation&amp;#34; policy with seating servers, but a guest should never be told no on a request that is reasonable. <br&gt;<br&gt;Strike 2 - We weren&amp;#39;t greeted by a server for 10 minutes. It took even longer to get drinks out. Or server also did not make a single suggestion or operate by any Step of Service. Being a corporate restaurant, I imagine servers are trained on what a step of service is. What I did see, was servers standing around not working. All congregating around the POS systems and chatting, not waiting in line to ring things in. I saw a staff that did not practice teamwork, or Full Hands In/Full Hands Out. Our server was clearly busy and dealing with more than she could handle. She was triple sat, which is an unacceptable practice and your hosts are setting up your servers for failure. Not once did I see a manager floating around or doing table visits so I could express my concerns. After placing the entree order and waiting 45 minutes, and the appetizer still had NOT arrived, we decided to leave. <br&gt;<br&gt;In conclusion, my experience was terrible and I will never return and encourage others to do the same. Just because your company name is a chain restaurant, does not mean you have to operate like one. As we left my partner made the comment, &amp;#34;this restaurant is dead, it can&amp;#39;t even be repaired.&amp;#34; We weren&amp;#39;t expecting &amp;#34;fine dining,&amp;#34; but we did expect to be treated as guests, not customers.

She wanted it to be a special visit to show appreciation for me. Haven eaten at another Cheesecake Factory we decided to give the one in Memphis a try. First our server seem to be inexperienced or new so service was a little slow to start, then he was sat a nine person table right next to us. He took our order, then came back because they were out of one of the entrees we ordered. I ordered a salad with no olives and an entree. About 30 minutes later our entrees were delivered then my salad came after the entrees arrived...with olives (lots of them). Finally we call manager over and told her situation, even told her we were there for my birthday. She asked if we wanted a different server....at this point only thing left was dessert to order ...we said no (giving server every chance). Another server came and checked on us even discussed my birthday (how they were gonna embarrass me). We ordered dessert (cheesecake go figure). Our server brought us the check before our desserts were delivered, ran the credit card still before desserts arrived. Then brought our desserts over and dropped them off. My best friend started to cry...this build up to special night and you drop off our desserts and don&amp;#39;t say (or sing happy birthday) Now the night is ruined and we are both stunned.

I think this is mostly a pasta and appetizer place. Most of their pastas are great. Speaking of cheesecakes, all of them are pretty epic. You would never know they are all frozen cheesecakes shipped from their California facility. So do not freeze any cheese cakes if you buy them cause you&amp;#39;d be freezing them twice.
