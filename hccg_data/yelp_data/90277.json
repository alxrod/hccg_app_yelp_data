We sat in the bar as there was no wait. Our server greeted us quickly and took our drink orders. No issues.<br&gt;Then he disappeared for about 20 minutes. He finally came back to take our order. It&amp;#39;s now 5:50pm. At 6:15pm we see our waiter and ask him to please check on our food. He comes back about 5 minutes later saying they had an issue in the kitchen but our food will be coming out soon. He even mentioned that his manager gave him the ok to give us cheesecake. Ok....I&amp;#39;m ok with this.<br&gt;About 15 minutes later, the manager comes to our table to say that there was a computer screen glitch and tables whose orders were on this screen were lost so they had to re-enter the orders but food would be out soon and they were very sorry for the wait.

We figured the last entr\u00e9e would come soon so the 3 of us who had food did not start eating. After 10 minutes and no sign of our waiter again, I got up to go and look for someone. I found many of the servers standing at the bar having conversations. I found our server in the mix and asked him to please check on our 4th entr\u00e9e as we only received 3 about 10 minutes ago. He looks at me a little perturbed and asks another server if they can check on our 4th entr\u00e9e, orange chicken, because new customers arrived in the bar area that he needed to go greet and give menus to. I thought this was a bit rude. I go back to my table and two minutes later, the 4th entr\u00e9e arrives.

Waiting, waiting...........all done with cheesecake. One of my friends finished hers just waiting. Coffee finally comes out when we are no longer eating. We take a couple of sips and our server brings our check. 5 minutes later, he comes back and asks if he left us our check.<br&gt;I say yes but the cheesecake is still on the bill. He says what? And I remind him that due to our 45 minute wait for food, his manager offered us cheesecake. So he takes the check and removes one cheesecake. We look over the check again and look at that!

Waited for over 45 minutes without food. The people that sat behind us that came way after got their food first. And when I looked up to see the server and saw that the runner had dropped off the food at the table behind us first, he knew he screwed up.<br&gt;<br&gt;He had to call over his manager MEGAN I believe her name was, to come and explain what happened for him. He didn&amp;#39;t have the balls to even come check on us or apologize. <br&gt;<br&gt;My bf wanted to stay of course he was hungry and the manager promised they would make our food priority. I got my food first and my bf was still unfortunately waiting.. <br&gt;<br&gt;He finally got his food. Now check this out..<br&gt;<br&gt;To make this situation even worse, THE FOOD HAD CHEESE IN THE SALAD AFTER MY BF TOLD THEM HE WAS ALLERGIC TO DAIRY! My bf ate the salad almost complete and the cheese was buried at the bottom of the plate. We explained many times in the beginning that my bf couldn&amp;#39;t have dairy. <br&gt;<br&gt;Well whatdayaknow, they F*cked up yet again! Now my bf is pisssst. So he himself calls the manager out.

I had the worst experience ever here on Saturday, January 4th, 2020 @ 10:25 pm. A friend and I went to dinner to have dinner. When we were seated it took a good 15 minutes before our server finally came over. He took our order for water and bread. But before he walked off I informed him that I was ready to order. So I placed my order. I order the Thai Coconut-Lime Chicken with extra onions, no cashews, no mangos, and no coconut flakes. Then I wanted to order a Santa Fe Chicken Salad CHOPPED with Balsamic Vinaigrette. But something said no order it for here then just pack it yourself. So I did. My friend didn&amp;#39;t want anything. So he leaves then comes back 10-15 minutes later with our water and bread. Now he only bought us the wheat bread. I let that go. Then about 10 minutes later out comes my food with him and another server (a girl). The Thai Coconut-Lime Chicken had a piece of pasta on the plate (hints cross contamination). Then I see my salad. It was not chopped and had the four slices of tomatoes around it (as pictured on the websites menu page) looked awesome, but not what I had asked for. So I said it&amp;#39;s not chopped, the girl server said yes it is, I said it&amp;#39;s not and the tomatoes are still whole. She then says well that&amp;#39;s just for garnishment on the plate. I said I understand that but I wanted it all chopped together. She said it&amp;#39;s chopped, then put down the plate and walked off with the worst attitude ever. At this point I called her a rude bitch. My original server said I will remove the tomatoes. I said ok but it&amp;#39;s still not chopped like I asked. He was so confused and I said I would like it chopped finer then this, he still couldn&amp;#39;t understand what I was requesting. So then he said let me get the manager. I said yes please do. So the manager comes over introduce herself (I forgot her name, but nice lady) I explain to her and show her both of my meals and the issues. She didn&amp;#39;t seem to cate to much about what was going on with the Thai Coconut-Lime Chicken with pasta that doesn&amp;#39;t come with pasta. She was more focused on the salad and she too couldn&amp;#39;t understand what I meant by chopped. She asked what do mean chopped? This is our chopped. I said no it&amp;#39;s not. I informed her how I was just there on December 12th, 2019 to celebrate my 40th birthday and had no issues when ordering this same salad the same way. She then said well I can see if the chief chopped it the last time and if they have the work space to do it. I said you know what it&amp;#39;s ok. I&amp;#39;m good because I can&amp;#39;t understand how no one can&amp;#39;t comprehend chopped or chopped finer. She apologized and I told her I can&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s do hard about chopped. She then said again this is our chopped, the salad is prepared daily in the morning, I said it can&amp;#39;t be because you don&amp;#39;t offer this salad chopped and if it&amp;#39;s prepared in the morning that means they didn&amp;#39;t do like I requested. So then I just told her at this point I&amp;#39;m not even hungry and I&amp;#39;m not trying to be rude or disruptive or cause a seen. So I don&amp;#39;t want anything. She then said well I hate to waste this food I&amp;#39;m trying to help you. And was very apologetic, and I told her I hate to waste it too, but I&amp;#39;m no longer hungry and I&amp;#39;m not gonna pay for something I&amp;#39;m not gonna eat. She said I&amp;#39;ll take care of it. Then I started to explain to her why I request this salad chopped. It&amp;#39;s for health reasons. I then told her again when I was here just weeks ago I didn&amp;#39;t have to do all of this. When I go to the one in Marina Del Rey I have no problems. She said I just really hate to waste this food. I said you know what I can feed someone I see. I&amp;#39;ll take it and give it away. So she left and packed the food up and I left. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now as I&amp;#39;m walking out it&amp;#39;s like 4 other groups of families complaining about their service.

Most restaurants wanted a buyout for my party size (give or take 40 guests) which ranged anywhere from $4,000 and up; translation $100 person and up equates to RIDICULOUSNESS. After several failed attempts to settle on a reasonable price point that was affordable along with an inviting ambiance, I reached out to Cheesecake Factory. I was told they did not make reservations on the weekend, however my party size could be accommodated if I arrived one hour or more before the party time. GREAT! I arrived just before 5:40 for my 7:00 dinner. My party size was an expected 36 (32 showed up). I was greeted by a young lady, whose name I can&amp;#39;t remember, who was very pleasant. She listened to my need and explored my options for seating in the restaurant. I told her I was open to options and told me the manager would be over to walk me through the restaurant to choose my preferred seating location. Alex, the Manager, came over and greeted me with a smile; also very pleasant. Alex mentioned the patio area as an option which sits to the right of the entrance. It was PERFECT! Guests could come and not have to walk through the entire restaurant to find us. It was a heated patio too so I knew my guests would be comfortable. Alex explained he would situate the tables into chef&amp;#39;s tables about 6:30 which was completed 10 or so minutes before time. Alex had another gentleman assist with lighting the heaters. Alex provided instructions re guests arrival and remained very professional and pleasant. Daniela and Tyler were our servers. LISTEN! Those two young people handled us SO well!!!! Their hospitality was top notch!! There was a third young lady who temporarily came in to cover Tyler&amp;#39;s break. I believe her name was Marisela. She was good too! The other manager even helped out later in the evening. I didn&amp;#39;t catch her name but she was awesome sauce as well.

I prayed that God would work everything out as I asked for my birthday and He did that!! Every restaurant before Cheesecake was a roadblock. Either plates were too pricey and not enough product for the food or the drinks were limited in some way or other. Some of these restaurants want you to sign your name in blood they are SO high!!!

Order that drink and you won&amp;#39;t regret it. There was only one guest whose food was not to his liking but Daniela was attentive and brought the manager over to make sure my guest&amp;#39;s needs were met.

I received a confirmation email stating that my order was confirmed and would be ready for me at said location and time. I arrived at the restaurant and had mentioned I was there for a pick up, again, stating I had placed it online the day before. They DID NOT have my order there at all. I was lucky that they had the cheesecake I needed available, but now I have to wait 2-3 hours for it to be thawed enough to eat and it does NOT have the birthday message that I had needed it to say. I did not have time to find another option so settled for the mostly frozen cheesecake. <br&gt;Why implement an online ordering service if the restaurant won&amp;#39;t even be receiving the orders?

The waitress came back a while later saying that the pasta itself was made with pesto and asked if that was okay, I said it wasn&amp;#39;t and that I would like regular spaghetti pasta with marinara sauce. We had an understanding or so I thought. About half an hour passes and my meal finally arrives, but it&amp;#39;s the wrong order. The waitress that came out with my dish was different from the waitress who took my order so she went to go consult with her about this error. I was out eating lunch with my mom and her order came out just fine(even though her order was modified too) so I told her to eat without me. <br&gt;<br&gt;The waitress comes back about a minute later and tries to convince me that she made a mistake telling me that the pasta was covered in basil oil, not pesto, so there shouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem. She then proceeds to ask me what I am specially allergic to within pesto which made me feel like she was trying to find a reason to get me to eat the incorrect order and not have it remade. I tell her this was not what I ordered and just it&amp;#39;s presence in front of me started to give me a lot of anxiety. She retorts that I never said that I wanted marinara on my pasta and that I said I wanted it on my eggplant. Again, this woman was not my original waitress who took my order so I don&amp;#39;t know where she got that from and as I even clearly stated before, I told my original waitress that I wanted regular spaghetti with marinara instead of the pesto. However, she kept pinning the blame \u00a0on me and looked at me like &amp;#34;what do you want me to do about it&amp;#34; so I told her I wasn&amp;#39;t comfortable eating this and that I wanted what I ordered. She was obviously annoyed at this point and went back to the kitchen. <br&gt;<br&gt;My order was brought out again and she asked it was correct, it wasn&amp;#39;t, but I said it&amp;#39;s fine because I didn&amp;#39;t want to cause more of scene then this was already creating. My original waitress came by asking if everything was alright because she noticed that I haven&amp;#39;t even touch the food after ten minutes and I tell her that I wanted to take the food home. She could clearly tell I was very upset at this point because I was on the verge of tears out of pure frustration so she quietly packaged it up and left it on our table. I ended up wasting about $20 on a incorrect order I was not satisfied with and what made this all worse was that it&amp;#39;s not going to be eaten at all and was literally going to go to waste. <br&gt;<br&gt;The only good thing that came out of this was the Fried Cheese small plate with marinara sauce I ordered before things went downhill. The Fried Cheese small plate ended up becoming my lunch along with two small slices of the free bread which was sad because I haven&amp;#39;t eaten all day and was looking forward to a meal, not a snack with a side of attitude from that waitress. <br&gt;<br&gt;The wait for the small plates was about 20 minutes while the main course took an additional 30 minutes.

The menu has a wide variety and a nice selection for anyone in your party. \u00a0The location is pretty--it&amp;#39;s right by the ocean, and you can see all of the boats outside in the marina. \u00a0The overall atmosphere is nice, from the d\u00e9cor to the friendly staff.

I mean LOVE. Whenever I see them on a menu at any restaurant, I am immediately drawn towards them. \u00a0So over the years, I&amp;#39;ve had quite a few different ones. I can honestly say that Cheesecake Factory has THE best crab cakes I&amp;#39;ve ever had. They are my absolute favorite! I am a little disappointed, though, that lately they have become smaller and smaller...but other than that, they are amazing! These crab cakes contain a lot of crab!...not just filler like many other restaurants.<br&gt;<br&gt;Avocado Egg Rolls are also a must-try! The contrast between the avocados, sun-dried tomatoes, and tamarind-cashew dipping sauce, create wonderfully complex flavors of sweet, salty, and tangy.<br&gt;<br&gt;Entr\u00e9e favorites:<br&gt;- Evelyn&amp;#39;s Favorite Pasta - Lot of veggies, but delicious flavor! The sun-dried tomatoes and pine nuts definitely make this dish!<br&gt;- Bistro Shrimp Pasta - I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I saw this on one of those lists of really unhealthy pasta dishes...but let me tell you, it is worth those calories! Crispy battered shrimp, fresh mushrooms, tomato, and arugula tossed with spaghettini and a basil-garlic-lemon cream sauce. Does that not sound amazing or what?!<br&gt;- Pan-Seared Salmon with Angel Hair - The lemon-caper sauce is really good!<br&gt;- Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic - Mushrooms, pancetta, and peas are great combination in any pasta!<br&gt;<br&gt;Dessert:<br&gt;I know we&amp;#39;re talking about The Cheesecake Factory here, but truthfully, I&amp;#39;m not the biggest fan of cheesecake. GASP, I know. However, they do have a few non-cheesecake options, to which I am very pleased with.

It just doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a valet restaurant. Very unnecessary. Maybe next time we&amp;#39;ll use the meters on the street. <br&gt;<br&gt;2). Sparrows &amp;amp; other small birds kept flying in for scraps. <br&gt;<br&gt;When we had lunch here, it was a Monday at around 11:30. It was moderately busy while we were there, then when we left at around 12:30, a few groups were waiting to be seated. <br&gt;<br&gt;The restrooms were clean. They are located at the front to the left of the desserts, fyi. <br&gt;<br&gt;I had the turkey sandwich with a side salad from the lunch menu. The portions are generous. To drink, I had the &amp;#34;Frozen Iced Mango.&amp;#34; It was so delicious. It even came with a slice of pineapple which I don&amp;#39;t care for, but I even nibbled on it a little. I just wish they had blended it a little more. It was a little on the chunky side. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. She tried fairly hard to get us to order some dessert, but I had to decline. I don&amp;#39;t have a yearning for sweets after every meal is all. <br&gt;<br&gt;While I am not Cheesecake Factory crazy like some people I know, this location is a fantastic one.<br&gt;<br&gt;Review #195", "rating": 4, "date": "10/10/2013"}, {"text": "It has been a long time since I been here and I remember that the food was really good, but today WOW it was great.

They can substitute for other pastas as well which is a nice option. Portion size is pretty big here and it&amp;#39;s often hard for me to finish what I order. You can always take part of it home though so you can save some room for a slice of cheesecake :)<br&gt;<br&gt;The Pasta Da Vinci comes with saut\u00e9ed chicken, mushrooms, and onions in a wine sauce. The chicken is tender and slightly crispy at the edges. Overall most pieces aren&amp;#39;t too dry to eat comfortably. The sauce has a hint of sweetness to it and you can barely taste the wine. Solid dish. One of my favorites when the pasta doesn&amp;#39;t come swimming in sauce which is what happened this time unfortunately. In general the pasta dishes here are usually quite oily and the sauce quite heavy so I like to request for the sauce on the side. It&amp;#39;s a hit or miss with this request because sometimes they get it right and sometimes they don&amp;#39;t. When it does, I&amp;#39;d give it a 4/5, otherwise like this time, unfortunately it&amp;#39;d only be a 3/5.<br&gt;Overall: 3/5<br&gt;<br&gt;SERVICE:<br&gt;Usually within a few minutes of sitting down, someone comes by to drop off some warm bread to snack on.

We didn&amp;#39;t have to wait too long for our food to arrive and our server checked up on us from time-to-time.<br&gt;Overall: 4/5<br&gt;<br&gt;DECOR/AMBIANCE:<br&gt;Casual. They try to make the restaurant more upscale by dimming the lights at night and having a heated outdoor patio. The restaurant is situated at a nice spot overlooking the bay but you can&amp;#39;t see much at night. There is a bar area off to the right where people can watch sports and grab drinks. You can also eat there as well if you don&amp;#39;t mind smaller tables. Some of the tables in the restaurant itself are a bit small and it can get cramped, especially if you&amp;#39;re at a table for 2.<br&gt;Overall: 4/5<br&gt;<br&gt;There is a parking lot out front but it is valet only unfortunately. There are a handful of spots to the right of the lot for people picking up to-go orders. If you&amp;#39;re lucky maybe you can snag one of the metered parking spots along the street on Harbor Drive or park by the pier and walk over.

They bring out two types of bread, sourdough and squaw bread. I like the squaw bread the best.

I like the small plates menu because they are small sides that are like appetizers at a cheaper price. These fries we got were only $6.95. It was a such a great deal!

My mom got the most popular chicken dish, chicken madeira! It is no wonder this is so popular because it is delicious. There are two large chicken breasts topped with asparagus, mushroom madeira sauce and mozzarella cheese! It comes with two large scoops of mashed potatoes too!

I was so surprised at how big the lunch portion is! It comes with two large meat patties that were topped with thick gravy and grilled onions.

The only issue with our visit was the parking, we had to pay I think $5 for valet parking, you cannot park the car yourself, and there is not a lot of parking on the streets.

Everyone including Ashley a manager and Chris the general manager needs to do their job properly. Second, no one was sincerely empathetic. Ashley still wanted us to pay for a meal that was cold, we had to keep asking for condiments and glass of milk that was ordered. She also asked if we wanted to order something else. Why would we order more food to spend more money??? We had to keep asking for things which made me lose my appetite. Mind you, another table had the same level of service which was horrible.

The first time we were here late on a weekday and it was a quiet evening dinner on the docks. The second time we were here in the middle of a Saturday afternoon and it was very loud and busy. Nothing wrong with that, hey, it&amp;#39;s a popular place! However, I don&amp;#39;t think the staff is quite equipped to keep up with the large crowds during busy hours. My boyfriend actually got gum on his pants when he slid into the booth from brushing his knee against the table corner. Someone had chewed their gum and stuck it right on the corner and the staff had completely missed it during cleanup! It was so gross! We alerted our server and showed him the gum stuck right there on my boyfriend&amp;#39;s knee. The server didn&amp;#39;t seem to really care at all, but did get the manager over. By the time the manager made it over, he&amp;#39;d cleaned the gum off his pants and the manager&amp;#39;s offer was to pick up the dry cleaning bill... who in heck dry cleans jeans? If we&amp;#39;d been in nice suits that would have been a great offer but we were in Saturday afternoon casual wear. The jeans can be washed, we were upset about the cleanliness of someone else&amp;#39;s gum from someone else&amp;#39;s mouth on his clothes and embarrassment of having a stain there at the second. Plus pulling it off was not fun at all! We should have at the very least had our appetizer comped or received a coupon good for a future visit. I understand the manager&amp;#39;s thinking may have been sometimes people come up with lame excuses to try and get a free meal so he was offering a useful, non restaurant related remedy. However, to us with a genuine complaint and a general disgusting problem this really wasn&amp;#39;t a good deal. I wish he&amp;#39;d left the gum on his pants for the manager to witness, maybe then he would have been disgusted too, but he just wanted to get cleaned up. <br&gt;<br&gt;Other users have mentioned disapproval of the forced valet parking, and we have to agree with that.

There was people sitting behind us and to the side of us and they would pass by and attend them every few minutes but to us they didn&amp;#39;t.

It&amp;#39;s valet only $4 plus tip. However, I believe on the weekdays, you have the option to self park in the very tiny lot on the right after you enter. Later on, I found out that the parking lot isn&amp;#39;t owned by CCF so they had to pay the city money to use it and therefore, the fee passed down to the consumers.

Normally when I go here, and it&amp;#39;s not terribly frequent, every thing is quite delightful. The waitstaff is usually cheerful, kind and helpful and food is always good. The food was good as usual but the service left much to be desired. Our waitress, Amber S., needs to find another line of work. Seriously. She hardly checked on us after we were served our food unless I flagged her down. She went sailing past our table numerous times without checking to see if we needed anything and I could hear her at other tables surrounding us asking if they needed this or that but we always had to catch her in mid-flight. After about the third flag down, I sensed a bit of an attutude so I decided it was time to go. We then went another stretch of her basically ignoring us unless we flagged her down. Once she brought the check, she waited until I had my attention diverted and she zips by and grabs the folder off of the table before I could address what needed to be done in regards to the bill because I was using a giftcard as partial payment of the check.

Moving on...<br&gt;<br&gt;The parking situation can be tricky if you go during their busy hours (duh) but it&amp;#39;s valet so you only have to deal with it until you get to the front of the line. Parking is $4. There&amp;#39;s always people who are a bit fishy when it comes to valet parking but I&amp;#39;ve never had a problem here. They open the door for you, tell you everything you need to know, and send you on your way. When it&amp;#39;s time to go home they get your car to you ASAP, they run to it like they&amp;#39;re in some kind of competition. It&amp;#39;s especially appreciated during cold nights.<br&gt;<br&gt;I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE their outdoor seating. The entire time you&amp;#39;re eating you have a view of all the boats docked at the harbor. During the day you have the sun shining with a pleasant breeze and when the sun begins to set it looks really pretty. For those colder nights you find yourself sitting outside they have heaters which definitely do their job because I have never been cold out there but I always have issues when I go to other places. <br&gt;<br&gt;Indoor seating is pretty much &amp;#39;seen one, seen all&amp;#39; as far as Cheesecake goes. There&amp;#39;s \u00a0nothing really special. I&amp;#39;ve eaten inside once and I have no complaints, I just prefer sitting outdoors. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now, the staff. Umm I wish these people worked EVERYWHERE. I have never once had an issue with anyone who has been assigned to my table. There&amp;#39;s never been an attitude and most of the time I end up having a great conversation with them. For my last birthday at one point we carried on a lengthy conversation with someone who wasn&amp;#39;t even assigned to us, he was so animated and hilarious! I definitely love that I never have to worry about how my service is going to be when I go here, they have won me over. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food is your regular Cheesecake food, there&amp;#39;s nothing special here that you can&amp;#39;t find in other locations. My favorite thing to get would have to be the sweet corn tamale cakes, which are great for sharing with the entire table, and the herb crusted fillet of salmon. The salmon comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus with some kind of sauce. It&amp;#39;s my go-to dish if I don&amp;#39;t want to flip pages. The cheesecake...there are no flaws. My favorite is the basic strawberry one but I&amp;#39;ve tried many of them and they all are sooooo good. During the holidays they always seem to throw in a new flavor so if you&amp;#39;re a fan of christmas candy chances are one of those will end up being an inspiration for their season cheesecake.", "rating": 4, "date": "3/13/2013"}, {"text": "I just realized for the many times I&amp;#39;ve been here, i haven&amp;#39;t written a review yet! First thing you&amp;#39;ll notice: huuuge parking lot BUT valet only! why?!? $4 valet too....<br&gt;<br&gt;FOOD:<br&gt;This time around I ordered the jambalaya pasta while my gf ordered the pasta with chicken and scampi sauce. The jambalaya had great flavor: spicy with a bit of sweetness from the onions and bell peppers. However the noodles and shrimp were way over-cooked. Noodles were mushy and past the point of al dente. Shrimp when cooked right has a snap when you bite into it. These had a slightly mushy exterior. Also, the whole dish felt overly oily, but I think that is with all pasta at Cheesecake. 2/5<br&gt;The chicken with scampi sauce is better: the noodles are cooked al dente and the dish didn&amp;#39;t feel as heavy as the jambalaya. 4/5<br&gt;Overall: 3/5<br&gt;<br&gt;SERVICE:<br&gt;Our food came in a timely manner and everything went smoothly. Our waitress was nice and checked up on us every so often.<br&gt;Overall: 4/5<br&gt;<br&gt;DECOR/AMBIANCE:<br&gt;The restaurant overlooks the bay and is very beautiful during the day, but you won&amp;#39;t see much at night. Dimly lit restaurant that has a casual feel even though I know Cheesecake tries to make it very upscale. <br&gt;Overall: 4/5<br&gt;<br&gt;Their pasta can be hit or miss. As with my Jambalaya tonight, it was a miss, but my gf&amp;#39;s dish was good. I really don&amp;#39;t get why they require valet service for a place that has such a large parking lot. Their cheesecakes are great, but only if you have room for it afterwards. Their portions are pretty large. <br&gt;<br&gt;PRO-TIP: if you get the pasta, get the sauce on the side so that you can mix in your own amounts to prevent the overly oily and heavy feeling of the sauce.", "rating": 4, "date": "12/8/2014"}, {"text": "Delicious delicious delicious!!!!

The Pear gorgonzola flatbread was nice. I do however prefer the pear cut into thinner slices blanketed over the bread so there is a more perfect amount of pear in each bite. These were big cubes sprinkled on so some bites had too much pear, and other bites no pear at all. <br&gt;<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LRUtlkWr8TSG6e5C_76fhw?select=PUjR3f7RqNeYlloyEaxVfA\"&gt;yelp.com/biz_photos/LRUt\u2026</a&gt;<br&gt;<br&gt;The white bean hummus was very nice and creamy.

The ocean/waterfront provides the perfect backdrop for dining (definitely recommend coming here if you are planning a romantic meal for that special someone).<br&gt;<br&gt;The first time I came to this location, it was for an anniversary dinner on a weeknight and it was pretty late - around 9 p.m. But that ended up being extremely beneficial, as there were hardly any customers and our server was most attentive.<br&gt;<br&gt;One of the reasons why The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants is due to its extensive menu. There is truly something for everyone on there (picky eaters and those who love exotic cuisine). And did I mention the selection when it comes to cheesecakes/desserts?<br&gt;<br&gt;For first-timers, here&amp;#39;s what I would recommend (based on my love for cheese and easy-to-please palate):<br&gt;<br&gt;Fried Macaroni and Cheese (appetizer): This gooey, cheesy mac and cheese mixture gets even better when deep fried and covered with a thin, crispy crumb layer. Cheese simply oozes out of the shell with every bite (truly a must for cheese lovers). The four mac and cheese balls are served with a creamy marinara sauce (not a very strong tomatoey taste) and bits of shredded cheese on top.<br&gt;<br&gt;Macaroni and Cheese Burger (glamburger): This burger definitely falls under the &amp;#34;gourmet&amp;#34; category. It&amp;#39;s unique because it includes a slightly flattened deep-fried mac and cheese ball (like the ones featured in the appetizer mentioned above) atop a charbroiled patty, Cheddar cheese sauce, lettuce, tomato, pickles, an onion and mayo. I would recommend only eating half of this savory burger if you plan to save room for dessert.<br&gt;<br&gt;Grilled Cheese Sandwich (sandwich): This used to be a staple on the very bottom of the &amp;#34;Glamburgers and Sandwiches&amp;#34; portion of the menu, but the eatery has since taken it off ever since the menu was revised. I was told, however, that I could still order this delicious grilled cheese upon request. The dish features the customer&amp;#39;s choice of cheese sandwiched between two pieces of egg-battered bread and is served with French Fries that are generously salted and tasty.<br&gt;<br&gt;Chicken Madeira (specialties): This chicken dish is famous as the eatery&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;most popular chicken dish.&amp;#34; Flavorful and savory, this one is definitely a winner. The dish contains a couple pieces of tender, saut\u00e9ed chicken breast topped generously with melted Mozzarella cheese and pieces of asparagus. It&amp;#39;s also covered with flavorful mushroom Madeira sauce and is served with fluffy mashed potatoes. Again, if you&amp;#39;re a cheese lover, you&amp;#39;ll want to indulge in this savory dish.<br&gt;<br&gt;Chicken Piccata (specialties): The flavor from the capers combined with the strands of Angel Hair pasta are probably the crowning glories of this dish. It features saut\u00e9ed chicken breast topped with lemon sauce, mushrooms and capers. I would recommend asking for extra cheese for additional flavor/savoriness.<br&gt;<br&gt;Adam&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple (cheesecake): Be forewarned - this is probably one of the sweetest cheesecakes on the menu, but it&amp;#39;s definitely one of my favorites. This decadent dessert features the original cheesecake in an Oreo Cookie crust and includes caramel, chunks of Butterfingers and Reese&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Cups, and peanut butter throughout. Peanut butter lovers will especially appreciate the fresh dollop of peanut butter mousse that comes atop the cheesecake. <br&gt;<br&gt;Reese&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake (cheesecake): Even though this sounds overwhelmingly sweet, ironically, this cheesecake isn&amp;#39;t as sweet as its close cousin, the Adam&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, because it contains layers of moist chocolate fudge cake in between the layers of cheesecake (versus layers of pure cheesecake). The layers of moist chocolate cake offset and complement the layers of cheesecake in a nice way, and peanut butter lovers will rejoice upon eating the dollop of peanut butter mousse atop the dessert. There are generous chunks of Reese&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Cups (my favorite candy) loaded in the cheesecake layers, and there are also thin layers of caramel. Finally, the crust is an absolute wonder, as it&amp;#39;s covered with Reese&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Cups as well. <br&gt;<br&gt;Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake (specialty cheesecake): Currently, the regular &amp;#34;Oreo&amp;#34; cheesecake has been replaced with the &amp;#34;Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake&amp;#34; on the dessert menu. I personally prefer the regular &amp;#34;Oreo&amp;#34; cheesecake because it does not contain the layer of Oreo Cookie mousse (whereas the &amp;#34;Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake&amp;#34; does).

The food during our visit yesterday was no different, so my review is based on customer service.<br&gt;<br&gt;I took my parents to this location yesterday for lunch and received lack of customer service. I can&amp;#39;t say it was bad or terrible, but a lack of service because we felt our server was hardly around or took a long time. It took a while until we first saw our server, so I figured we order everything all at once - drinks, appetizers, and main dishes.<br&gt;<br&gt;While waiting, I noticed it was taking a while before we got our waters. In fact, my dad&amp;#39;s cocktail was brought sooner by another server than our waters from our actual server. Anyone notice something odd about that, but me? I don&amp;#39;t know how long it takes to make cocktails, but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it would take much longer to make cocktail drinks than pour a glass of water. Also, it&amp;#39;s probably a lesser complaint than what I&amp;#39;m about to share, but when our bread was brought out, I noticed our server had another table&amp;#39;s check booklet on top of our bread. You don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s hands or dirty tables these booklet carrying checks have touched. So, to see that on top of our bread was a little rude, I thought.<br&gt;<br&gt;After our meal, I asked for the check and boxes for our leftovers. Again, it took a while for our server to deliver these items. She first comes by for our boxes, but doesn&amp;#39;t have our check. When finally she hands me our check on her second trip to our table, she was nowhere to be found for me to pay for our meals. At this point, I pretty much had it because I was in a hurry. So, I went to the front counter expecting to pay there. To my disbelief, I was told by 3 ladies near the front counter working the dessert bar that I would have to go back to our table to pay. WTF? Not until I asked a gentleman behind the counter if he was the manager did I find out that it was absolutely fine to pay at the front counter. At that point, I pretty much lost it. I&amp;#39;m not one to be vocal and start a scene with my complaints, but the fact 3 ladies at the front counter, including one who takes down the number of guests at the front, did not have a clue what to do totally blew my mind. Either they did not have any idea how to resolve a problem or they did not want to deal with it. I&amp;#39;m really upset how the situation was handled. I had to wait until I asked the gentleman behind the register, if he was the manager in order for me to pay at the front counter. I&amp;#39;ve never worked as a server, but if you can&amp;#39;t ring a customer at the front counter because it&amp;#39;s the duty of the table server, I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a manager who can override and get it done. Why did no one do that in the first place? Because I was able to get it done... and I don&amp;#39;t even work there.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food is delicious, but the customer service here during our visit yesterday was nonexistent. The ladies who work here rubbed me off the wrong way and gave me the impression they had no clue how to resolve an issue. A COMPLETE DISREGARD for customer satisfaction.

Our party of 6 are all fans of the chain, and we were simply shocked at how poor the service was with our waitress (mid-late 30s blond with really short hair). We were there on the 28th, seated on the patio at around 9:30 pm. This is the nicest Cheesecake Factory I&amp;#39;ve seen to date, which made the service even more disappointing.<br&gt;<br&gt;To preface my issues ... I realize restaurants are strangers serving other strangers. We don&amp;#39;t know each other, and I don&amp;#39;t think the world revolves around me or my loved ones BUT as customers, we want to 1) eat good food, and at a sit down establishment such as Cheesecake ... 2) be made feel our business is valued and presence desired. If someone is having a special day (especially) and we&amp;#39;ve chosen the establishment you work at to celebrate, it&amp;#39;s extremely insulting to be treated with total apathy regarding customer service in general, much less that something special is happening. After all, it&amp;#39;s why you .... the waiter or waitress .... are able to collect a tip which should be commensurate with your level of service (the waitress is fortunate I have enough integrity and too big a conscience to NOT leave a 0% tip ... but in hindsight, I truly wish I would have).<br&gt;<br&gt;The night we attended was my Daughter&amp;#39;s 23rd birthday and an ideal rendezvous point for &amp;#34;the rest of the family&amp;#34; to meet with her and her fiance (who had just proposed in a helicopter just prior to meeting us). After having waited an hour and fifteen minutes to be seated, it was another 15 minutes after being shown to the table before we were greeted by our waitress. After being informed by a member of our party as to &amp;#34;the birthday girl&amp;#34; being present as well as the proposal just having happened, the waitresses response was an indifferent &amp;#34;Oh&amp;#34; followed by a monotone request to another guest asking them what they wanted. We had to ask 3 times for straws. My daughter&amp;#39;s steak was served with no knife, and we sat for another 10-15 waiting to see her before finally flagging a different waiter down (we were also brought our straws by a different male waiter). Additionally, I placed my order and our waitress was gone for 15 minutes before returning to tell me they no longer carry that item on the menu and she&amp;#39;d forgotten to tell me previously. When leaving, she dumped a dirty fork in my GFs lap (who was wearing a white dress) and responded (still consistently apathetic) by saying &amp;#34;Yeah, I saw it going over the side there&amp;#34;, but didn&amp;#39;t apologize at all. In fact, not once was there an apology for anything being slow, forgotten, etc. <br&gt;<br&gt;What makes this all more insulting is observing this waitress&amp;#39;s service to the female couple at the table just next to ours. One of the female customers informed the waitress she&amp;#39;d just proposed to her (now) fiance sitting next to her, and they were engaged. It was the first (and only) semblance I saw of happiness, kindness, and customer service come from this waitress and one would think they&amp;#39;d all been life long besties based on the warm socializing and prompt customer service that consistently transpired. <br&gt;<br&gt;The ONLY saving grace to this place getting 2 stars vs 1, is the 2 male waiters that assisted with our table. They seemed genuinely concerned as to whether we had what we needed, and displayed more sense of urgency in meeting our needs than what was actually necessary, but given our waitress&amp;#39;s behavior, it was simply nice to see and much appreciated.<br&gt;<br&gt;Food was (at least) consistent with what can be expected at Cheesecake Factory. If it&amp;#39;s a regular night out, you&amp;#39;re not in any kind of hurry, and customer service is irrelevant as long as food is good, then &amp;#34;sure&amp;#34;go here. If there&amp;#39;s any kind of special event going on and you don&amp;#39;t wanted it tainted by someone with an absolute shite attitude serving you, it&amp;#39;s worth giving consideration to another location. Despite seeing positive reviews as well regarding this particular CF, it&amp;#39;s interesting to note the parallels in description of bad service for those who also rated it poorly.

What really did it was that when I informed the manager that we were displeased about the amount of time it took to let us know, over an hour, was not acceptable. The manager \u00a0raised her voice and responded with attitude, frowned red face and said; &amp;#34;It is not our fault the person before us beat us to the last salmon&amp;#34;. That was incorrect because the person who did not order enough salmon for that night dropped the ball and that person was at fault. Dont know who makes the orders of food and fish, my guess it was the same restaurant manager that displayed unprofessionalism and disregard for care and service for their guest. Additionally, when they brought out the salad I informed one of the waiters that the salad she had in her hand was for my father, sitting across from me, but she \u00a0continued to ask another waiter who the salad was for. The waiter pointed at my father confirming what I had just told her who that salad was for. She disregarded my advise, ignored me and proceeded without an apology. We spent $700 dollars dining on one of our favorite restaurants we frequent, but the Redondo Beach Cheese Cake Factory was our worst dining experience hands down.", "rating": 1, "date": "8/7/2017"}, {"text": "Really nice place love the service and the food is great.

I have had cheesecake at Junior&amp;#39;s in NYC and it was not that expensive and in my opinion it tasted better, but for the south bay this was very good. <br&gt;<br&gt;I went with a classic cheesecake with strawberries which was delicious and my bf had the chocolate raspberry truffle which he said was &amp;#34;Nom nom nom&amp;#34; so two thumbs up there. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;If you are having a craving for good cheesecake this is a great place to go.", "rating": 4, "date": "5/29/2014"}, {"text": "It&amp;#39;s almost surreal to be writing a negative review about the cheesecake factory in Redondo Beach. I have been a frequent, almost weekly, guest for probably the better part of 25 years now. I love everything about this restaurant the location the decor the layout. This past Sunday, two days ago, \u00a0I stopped by the restaurant for brunch. We were seated near the window \u00a0and I found a big clump of hair hanging from the window. I waved over the waiter and asked him if he would clean it up - I have no idea how the buser could have missed it - which they immediately did. I ordered tea and while waiting found that my silverware could not possibly have been washed. They came over to replace the teaspoon and then brought a dirty filthy tea cup which looked like someone had rubbed food on the outside of it. At that point I asked to speak with the manager. The manager came over and identified himself as someone who who had been transferred in from the \u00a0Marina Del Rey location \u00a0&amp;#34;clean things up&amp;#34; at Redondo Beach. I found it fascinating that even with the tales of the hair and the spoon and the cup he offered me a new cup of tea at no charge. Space cleaned a bit smarmy to me but I moved forward. When my food came my sisters had a very large very thick black hair in it. At that point we called the dinner dad. The manager comes back by tells us he is not going to charge us for our food. Really??!! Something is very, very, wrong. He should&amp;#39;ve been falling all over himself apologizing for The experience but instead he was making it sound like he was doing us a favor by not charging us for food that we couldn&amp;#39;t even eat.

We were promptly seated in a booth, and we were told that Antoinette would be our waitress. She had never before been our waitress. She took much longer than usual to take our orders, and then we waited for our food. As we waited for nearly an hour, Antoinette must have passed our table nearly 10 times without saying a word. After we sat down, an African American family sat behind us and Antoinette stopped at their table 4 or more times, and they received their food before we did. By the time we began eating, the African American family had already left, and I made an effort to check by looking behind me. I watched Antoinette, and she was waiting on 4 different tables near us, but never once stopped to ask us if we needed water, NOR did she tell us &amp;#34;your food will be out shortly, sorry for the wait, etc.&amp;#34; She also was not knowledgeable, and wanted to charge me extra for a turkey burger patty. She told me that if I wanted the turkey burger patty wrapped in lettuce, that it would be considered protein style, and that it would be an additional charge. However, in previous times there was no additional charge, and with barbeque sauce. <br&gt;I told my friend that I was going to wait till 10:25pm, more than an hour after we arrived at the Cheesecake Factory, to inquire about the whereabouts of our food. At 10:25pm, I walked up to the hostess and told her that we had been here for more than an hour, and we did not have our food yet. I then saw our &amp;#34;waitress&amp;#34; Antoinette, and asked her &amp;#34;where is our food, it&amp;#39;s been an hour&amp;#34; and she rudely said &amp;#34;I DON&amp;#39;T MAKE THE FOOD, WHY DON&amp;#39;T YOU GO BACK INTO THE KITCHEN AND ASK WHERE YOUR FOOD IS.&amp;#34; I was shocked and speechless, and then I told her &amp;#34;isn&amp;#39;t that your job?&amp;#34; and she rudely responded &amp;#34;YOU DON&amp;#39;T TALK TO ME THAT WAY.&amp;#34; I told her that I had the right to ask where my food was and she stormed off and once again said &amp;#34;YOU DON&amp;#39;T TALK TO ME THAT WAY.&amp;#34; <br&gt;It became crystal clear that my friend and I were being directly targeted, and this was a clear case of discrimination. I spoke to the manager, Aurelia, who was polite and professional, and she immediately brought out our food. It turns out that our food was just sitting on the counter, and ANTOINETTE WAS AWARE OF THIS, BUT SHE PURPOSELY DID NOT WANT TO BRING OUR FOOD OUT. Antoinette never apologized, she just walked by and gave me nasty looks.<br&gt;I will remind all of you that Antoinette is an employee of The Cheesecake Factory, and represents the company, and according to Respondent Superior, a company is liable for the wrongful actions of their employees. Antoinette failed to conduct herself according to the code of conduct of Cheesecake Factory, and failed to perform her duties, and went as far as telling me to perform her duties for her, when she told me to &amp;#34;go back into the kitchen and ask where my food was.&amp;#34; In addition, she used insulting language when she raised her voice and told me that &amp;#34;she doesn&amp;#39;t cook the food.&amp;#34; <br&gt;I will NEVER allow Antoinette&amp;#39;s uncivilized, and hostile conduct to go unnoticed. While employees sometimes make mistakes, this was a CLEAR CASE of malicious, hateful, and purposeful conduct that Antoinette carried out with the specific intent of ruining our dinner experience; therefore. I am 100% convinced that Antoinette was completely aware of the fact that our food was ready, and was purposely neglecting us, and she was just waiting for me to inquire about my food so she could lash out. <br&gt;I emailed the district manager, Mr. DeMoro, on Dec. 29th, and he never responded. I had to call him, and he said &amp;#34;Oh I forgot.&amp;#34; I called again, and he told me that Antoinette offered NO explanation as to why she acted the way she did, and that disciplinary action had been taken against her. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) grade for this place is a &amp;#34;D-&amp;#34;, I&amp;#39;m not surprised. They never responded to my BBB complaint. How unprofessional. The CEO of Cheesecake Factory (Mr. Overton) dropped out of his sole graduate degree (UC Hastings Law School). When I called corporate, some Irish woman spoke to me on his behalf, and told me that I &amp;#34;chose to stay&amp;#34; and finish dinner after the incident with Antoinette, as if I was partially to blame, when I absolutely wasn&amp;#39;t. I felt that she was speaking WAY above her level, but this is typical of undereducated people. UPDATE: they cut the size of their black out cake by a 3rd, and they are charging the same price, $8.50 for a tiny piece of cake. Disgraceful! I won&amp;#39;t be returning to this loud, unprofessional, and dismissive establishment EVER AGAIN. I can get better service and ambiance elsewhere, and BETTER &amp;amp; CHEAPER DESSERTS.

Upon arrival we were told that one member of our party had to wait in a special area for the manager who was walking around the restaurant surveying open tables and availability to come and quote you a time to seating. \u00a0The rest of my party was told to wait in the bar. \u00a0This was a family birthday dinner for my daughter, so I was required to be separated from my family on my daughters birthday so that I could wait for 15 minutes so that the manager could tell me that it was going to be an hour until they could seat us. \u00a0They provided me with a buzzer, why couldn&amp;#39;t they have told me that they were going to alert me as to when the manager was available to speak with me?<br&gt;3.

Add this to rising prices and this may be the last time I go to Cheesecake Factory for a while if ever again. <br&gt;<br&gt;What corporate and management fail to realize is that most people go to Cheesecake Factory for special occasions and/or want a meal that is not typical and will therefore pay accordingly.

We had a party of 9 and upon placing our name on the waiting list we waited about 20+ minutes for a table which seemed like a long wait because at the time we arrived the CCF was not all that busy. <br&gt;<br&gt;Upon being seated we had a short wait for our server to show up which was fine because it gave members of our party time to talk. A server finally arrived and took our drink order. From the time our drink orders were placed until the time they arrived on the table was a good 10 minutes. I ordered water with lime; my drink was served in a plastic mug with melted ice and no straw, not that big of a deal but you expect a higher level of service at the CCF. <br&gt;<br&gt;I took a look at the menu and had forgotten how many things are on the menu. My mother used to tell me never trust a restaurant with lots of items on the menu which is a good point, how do these restaurants keep all of these items fresh? The simple answer is they usually cannot. With this is mind I went with a simple order. I ordered a chicken club with avocado on toasted wheat bread with no mayonnaise &amp;amp; no cheese. I also asked for the chicken on the sandwich to be grilled / cooked until it was black / burnt. I had the choice of having French fries or a green salad as a side; I decided to go with the green salad. <br&gt;<br&gt;The other members of our party ordered rice, to herb roasted chicken, to soup, to salads &amp;amp; burgers. The wait for the food to come out again took quite some time. When the food finally arrived at the table it was subpar at best. The wheat bread I had asked for was now soggy white bread which was barely even toasted, the green side salad I had ordered was wilted and when I finally picked up my sandwich it literally fell apart in my hand. I ended up taking the sandwich apart and eating the rest of it with a fork. When I took the sandwich apart I observed the chicken to have no grill marks, it was not blackened and it was not even close as ordered. I ate maybe half of the sandwich and decided to not test out the wilted greens that looked like they had not seen the inside of a refrigerator in quite sometime. During the course of our meal which lasted almost 2 hours I was never once asked if I wanted more water which I finished quickly while trying to wash down my meal. <br&gt;<br&gt;My friend ordered the herb roasted chicken which she only finished 1/3 of. I will have to say that I had a bite of the mashed potatoes that came with her meal and they were good but not great. The mashed potatoes were lumpy with the potato skins blended in which is just the way I like them. <br&gt;<br&gt;I was severely disappointed with the quality of my food. The Chef&amp;#39;s in the kitchen should also be disappointed in the quality of food they are allowing to leave their kitchen. I love to cook and I know I would of never of served a guest of mine let alone a paying customer a soggy sandwich that is unable to even be held without self-destructing. <br&gt;<br&gt;I looked around the table and every member of our party had a large majority of their food left over. They were either not all that hungry or like me they found the food to subpar. <br&gt;<br&gt;We had all spoken about ordering dessert before our food arrived but at the end of our meal everyone decided against it. <br&gt;<br&gt;There is little to no chance that I visit this location again. The last time I visited the CCF was the location in Marina Del Rey many years ago and I had a very similar experience in regards to the quality of food. In my personal opinion the CCF should focus on reducing their menu to ensure everything that is coming out of the kitchen meets the standards of the prices on the menu and the d\u00e9cor. <br&gt;<br&gt;There is no self-parking available at the CCF, it is all valet until I believe dinner hours. When dinner hours arrive you are still required to pay a nominal fee to park your vehicle. I refuse to leave my vehicle with a valet and luckily being a surfer who surfs in the general area I knew exactly where to park for free on the street and that is exactly what I did. <br&gt;<br&gt;I still had an enjoyable time. Our party had a good conversation and good laughs but if I called the food poor that would be giving it an upgrade. As stated above the Chef&amp;#39;s working in this kitchen should be embarrassed when a fast food restaurant is putting out better quality food then they are!!!", "rating": 2, "date": "8/3/2014"}, {"text": "I think this is one of my favorite cheesecke factory locations!The view and the ambiance is so much better than the CFs in inner cities.

We&amp;#39;ve been going to this Cheesecake Factory for so many years so I always think that the last BAD visit was just a random, once in a while situation. Yes, you have to take &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; bad with the good. Well, I think that bad service and bad food can be considered the norm at this Cheesecake Factory now. I can honestly say, at least the last 6 visits have been awful. Both the service and the food is lacking any quality. No joke - This Cheesecake Factory really sucks now!<br&gt;~The valet parking - the decorative trees at the entrance of the valet hang low so when I drove up in my F-150 truck, I tried to go as far in the middle as possible so not to let the trees rake the top of my truck. One of the packing attendants noticed and moved the little podium, which I thought was great. But then he made a comment in Spanish to the other 2 attendants, which I understood, then they all started laughing.<br&gt;~ We were a party of 6 however, we were led to be seated right away. When we were given a table right between a busboy station and the exit door to the deck. I didn&amp;#39;t say anything, I figured that every once in a while, you need to accept a crappy table. We waited 15 minutes for the waitress to approach our table, and waited an additional 25 minutes for waters and ice teas. We were given 1 batch of bread - 3 pcs for 6 people. We asked for more but never received any. The whole time we made the best of the day and stayed positive. The food arrived another 35 minutes after the drinks were served. And our ice teas were never once re-filled. We were all over the bad service and bad food so we didn&amp;#39;t have any desert. We received the bill before our plates were even cleared away from the table. By the way, during the whole meal - there was this 1 waitress that kept throwing dishes into a bin in the busboy station. Literally throwing them. They made this incredibly load sound that startled me each and every time. It was funny at first. We all laughed at it, but then it got really annoying.<br&gt;*By the way - I found something in my salad that neither my sister or I could make heads or tails on what it could be. Then 1 random waitress that over heard us talking took it and returned to explain it was a piece of onion. I know what an onion looks like, raw as well as cooked, sauteed, boiled, fried, steamed, poached, caramelized, broiled, damn it, that wasn&amp;#39;t a freaking piece of onion! Whatever, mental note - &amp;#34;Don&amp;#39;t think about that thing you found in your salad.&amp;#34;<br&gt;We then received the bill, of course before our plates were even cleared away from the table.

I dined here a few nights ago for an early dinner, which meant that my friend are I were able to catch the stunning winter sunset. We chose to sit outside on the patio, and were fortunate enough to be sat at one of the table right by the window. It was a little chilly at first, but after getting settled in, we were able to feel the warmth from the heaters that are scattered all along the patio area. I&amp;#39;ll give them one star for their convenient patio with an amazing view.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food here is actually pretty tasty. I ordered the chicken costoletta, and it was so delicious! The chicken was crispy fried, yet it wasn&amp;#39;t oily like normal fried chicken. This chicken dish came with some type of creamy lemon sauce, which seemed a little weird to me at first, but it ended up complementing the fried chicken very well. Another star for their killer costoletta.<br&gt;<br&gt;And of course, I couldn&amp;#39;t miss out on some cheesecake! My server did her whole show of telling us about the cheesecakes that they&amp;#39;re featuring, and also mentioned that one of which that they offered would lead to the company giving 25 cents to Feeding America for every slice sold. I thought that was a pretty nice gesture from the company. My friend and I decided to share a slice of the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake, and my oh my was it amazing! The cheesecake had a perfect mixture of cream and chocolate, maybe even a hint of vanilla? Well whatever is in it sure gave me a reason to add another star.<br&gt;<br&gt;The ambiance at the restaurant was really nice too. Sitting out on the patio was very relaxing. I could feel the cool crisp winter air, but I was still safe from shivering in the cold. The music and talking from other customers seemed very quiet, and it was very easy to have an intimate conversation without feeling like I was yelling to my friend. The patio&amp;#39;s calm environment got another star out of me.<br&gt;<br&gt;And finally, the very last star. Why did \u00a0I give this restaurant five stars? Well, not only did their food and location make my time here enjoyable, it was also the service. Every employee that came in contact with our table was very kind and helpful.

First the positives: We went at around 2pm and there was no wait for our party of five. The server came promptly and took our drink orders. Now the negatives: there is no self-park option. Vaiet parking costs $4 and there is no choice but to use it even if there are ample spaces available. The server took our appetizer orders which took a very long time to come out. The bread basket provided us was not full (it was short a few pieces), maybe the server thought that since we were ordering appetizers, we didn&amp;#39;t want as much bread? That should still be our choice, right? Finally, the food came but I have to say, the quality of the food did not seem as good as it once was. It all looked and tasted like the food was micro-waved and not freshly prepared. For example, the buffalo wings were soggy and tasted like those you purchase in bags at the supermarket. My son&amp;#39;s angel hair pasta was overcooked and my daughter&amp;#39;s and my entrees were overladen with mashed potatoes with the meat portion seemingly undersized. The price point of the menu should translate to better quality. The server did not come back to our table for a long time to check if everything was ok and whether we needed refills for beverages. \u00a0Cheesecake Factory used to be known for good quality food and large portions for sharing which justified the higher prices but recently, the focus seems to be more on the &amp;#34;Factory&amp;#34; part of the name - emphasis more on getting large parties in and out as fast as they can. Finally, on the bill, restaurants now often calculate the tip for you so you don&amp;#39;t have to so the math.

In both dishes it appeared that the pasta was prepared ahead of time and allowed to dry out before the sauce was added. For the Cajun pasta the linguini was clumped together as we have all seen happen when pasta sits in a colander after being cooked. A bit over cooked, on the mushy side, too. The Evelyn&amp;#39;s had a different problem- way too much oil and the rigatoni had a rubbery texture. One other person in our party of six ordered the same dish and had a similar comment about chewing on rubber. My guess is they make these ahead of time and let them sit under a heat lamp. Some advice- call Gordon Ramsay for a review of the methods in your kitchen and an update to that stuck in the eighties menu.<br&gt; \u00a0 I always liked the atmosphere, sitting by Redondo&amp;#39;s sleepy little small craft harbor where you can catch a view of the sunset.

I don&amp;#39;t understand how they allowed the hotel developer to build such an eyesore. This restaurant has given Redondo Beach millions of dollars over the years.

He was very patient with the 3 young children (and the adults!) when we placed our order. Everything was served promptly. My soda glass was refilled before I even knew it was empty! The food was, as usual, good quality. The best part of the whole meal was the dessert, of course. When they brought my cheesecake out and sang happy birthday, the plate they brought it on had &amp;#34;Happy Birthday Heather&amp;#34; written in chocolate with colorful sprinkles scattered around. It was better than any restaurant birthday dessert I have seen! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory management, wait and kitchen staff for taking good care of me on my birthday. <br&gt;<br&gt;My hope is that this serves as a learning experience. At my initial visit, the lack of attention to my needs as a customer was pervasive, being essentially ignored by multiple staff members. At my second visit it was exactly the opposite. I will be back, by myself sitting in the dining room as before, at sometime in the future. Hopefully, you will continue the positive standard you put forth on 4/25. If not, you will hear about it.", "rating": 5, "date": "4/28/2015"}, {"text": "You know what really pisses me off about this location? The parking. They have this giant lot for valet parking and off to the side is a small lot of about 15 spaces if you want to self park.

Course, it&amp;#39;s another 15 minutes before we can get our waiter to come and take the check... he actually ended up NEVER coming to get it, so at this point we just wanted to get the hell out of there.

Also, you are pretty much forced to valet park which is more of a minor annoyance since it is cheap, but I like to park my own car.

Typed in Mile instead of Mike. Not a big deal, but had to include it in my overall experience.<br&gt;<br&gt;We sat down and the waiter took a long time to get to us. When he finally did, he took our drink orders and when we inquired about some bread he said that they ran out an needed to make more. Understandable except that there were other tables who sat after us and they were served bread upon seating. We were told that the last of the bread went to the other table. We would have to wait. <br&gt;<br&gt;We then ordered main courses and waited appox. 45 minutes until our waiter came over to the table and said that he had to talk to the manager about why our food was taking so long. Nice to get the manager involved when he could have come to us first. He then said that the kids meal was holding up our order. Huh? I&amp;#39;ve never heard of 2 sliders holding up 3 full sized meals. In any case, a different server came out and gave us 2 of our 4 meals. We didn&amp;#39;t want to eat without the other meals arriving, and they should have kept the two in the back until the others were ready. Abiut 10 minutes later, the manager comes over with our other 2 meals. 1 of the other 2 was the wrong order. She got a Chicken Madiera instead of what she ordered, a Chicken Marsala. Again, not terrible as that could be an honest mistake. So we waited for another order to be cooked and in the meantime, my Memphis Burger I had found to be raw when I ordered it medium. I had to send it back and requested a new one. The manager brought the new order of Chicken Marsala and I waited and waited for the new burger to come out. 10 minutes later it finally came out, a piece of cheddar cheese was slapped onto it, not even melted as it should have been. Now I was finally ready to eat. Undercooked again. So I told them to just take it away since I was done trying to get a proper order completed. <br&gt;<br&gt;Then the waiter came to the table with a new waitress and said that she will take care of us from now on since her wanted to go on a break. What does she do? Left me the check! Nobody asked us if we wanted dessert, which we did. We all wanted a piece of cheesecake since I was in town from Phoenix and this was our vacation so we were going to splurge a bit. We all could notnbelieve that they just wanted us out of there. <br&gt;<br&gt;****UPDATE****<br&gt;Well, it seems as the only person who actually did get their meal correctly, may have contracted food poisoning that evening.

There was no outrageous behavior from the group up stairs nor did my husband, myself and a few other guest that we there waiting on a table smell any type of contraband being used in the facility. We were actually there long enough to see the party being asked to leave the establishment. The most upsetting thing to us was when we saw a gentleman (African American) and two young ladies being asked to leave also. They were not even a part of the party. They actually had a dinner table themselves. I really hate to say it, but it appeared this party had been racially profiled and discriminated on.

If you are having drinks with friends and don&amp;#39;t want to order a huge meal, they have a small plates menu to choose from that is about half or 1/3 the size of their normal appetizer portions.

This is partly my own fault because I was passive and didn&amp;#39;t ask for what I wanted. <br&gt;<br&gt;Quick and Dirty:<br&gt;Parking: -2 stars, they&amp;#39;ll try to trick you into valeting your car, but you can self park<br&gt;Location: 5 stars, beautiful right next to the water, but make sure you ask for seating next to the windows if you want them, especially if you look young. <br&gt;Food: 3 stars, It isn&amp;#39;t gourmet, except for their sauces. Once you run out of sauce, good luck finishing the big portions. <br&gt;Wine: Raven&amp;#39;s Wood Zin was good for its price. <br&gt;Service: 3.5 stars, pretty decent. Attentive enough.<br&gt;Overall: 3 stars. I wouldn&amp;#39;t really come back here except that it does have a nice atmosphere... that said, there are also other places on the water that I&amp;#39;d rather check out instead. <br&gt;<br&gt;Longer than needed review:<br&gt;<br&gt;Parking: \u00a0Negative 2 stars. When you enter the lot, you see a valet sign with a service price. If I hadn&amp;#39;t checked online and with yelp, I would have been conned into paying them $3.50 or so + tip to park my car like 20 feet away... instead I asked about the self-park lot... which is directly to the right of the valet sign. The problem is is that this lot is minuscule compared to the valet lot, which probably can accommodate more cars than the restaurant can diners. When we were leaving we saw a car or two lined up for the self-park lot.. so I guess I&amp;#39;d recommend coming a little earlier if you want to self-park. I think you can probably ask the valet if you can self-park on the valet lot side if the lot on the right side is full and/or just pay them the $3.50 because I guess it is a ritzier location. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;Location: \u00a0It is right on the water so it is a pretty nice location = 5 stars<br&gt;<br&gt;Seating: \u00a02 stars<br&gt;When we came they didn&amp;#39;t seem too busy. We asked for a table for two and were seated immediately on the upper level next to the wall, still within view of the windows, but weren&amp;#39;t really able to see out of them being as it was night (it is harder to see out at night when inside is brighter) and there were diners inbetween. I was kind of hoping for a seat closer to the windows but I was preoccupied and didn&amp;#39;t ask.. figuring that all the seat near the windows were already taken... I was mistaken. About three minutes after we were seated I saw the hostess lead an older couple to a sear near the window. Lesson for me: Ask to be seated near the window. What the hostess could/should have done: Ask our preference and/or let us know there were seats near the window. My thoughts: She probably saw that we were young and figured we wouldn&amp;#39;t spend/tip as much as older folks... I spent and tipped plenty, thank you. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food: \u00a0Sauce (5 stars), Portions (3.5 stars), Once you run out of sauce (2 stars) \u00a0<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve come to the conclusion that the cheesecake factory food is pretty sub-par but they have definitely mastered their sauces and give you a fair portion - we barely made a dent in our mashed potatoes. They don&amp;#39;t seem to marinate anything, i.e. once you run out of sauce you better ask for some salt, pepper, lemon, and hot sauce. My friend and I both ordered combos. My friend ordered a Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon. I ordered the Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira. They Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon were decent. The chicken madeira was bland even with all the cheese on top. The lemon sauce on the salmon was really truly freaking delicious. We ended the meal with a white chocolate raspberry truffle cheese cake. The presentation of the cheesecake was pretty... they sure used a ton of whip cream to get there so great for all your whip cream lovers. <br&gt;<br&gt;Waiter: Our first waiter I guess was breaking somebody and was really nice. He recommend a raven&amp;#39;s wood zin to go with our steaks. We ordered one glass of that and a glass of the house merlot just to test out. I&amp;#39;d recommend going with the zin.

I am a regular at the Sherman Oaks location, because that is where my office is, and I have never been so disappointed in the service, or lack thereof. <br&gt;As we approached the restaurant we knew there was going to be a long wait, as there were several groups waiting outside. We put our names down, and we were told that for a table of 7 inside it would be an hour and a half wait if not less. We decided to sit in the bar area and order a few drinks and appetizers while we were waiting for our pager to buzz. Approximately an hour and 40 minutes later, our pager buzzed and we went up to the front desk. We were then taken to our table, which was where we were just sitting! They sat us back in the bar area, had we wanted to dine there we could have ordered our dinner earlier and finished eating and not have waited an hour and half to be seated. In addition to the lousy seating area, the table cloth was dirty with recent stains from earlier guests. To make matters worse, the girl who brought us to our table, and whom we initially complained to, did not take the time to listen to our complaint or apologize. All she kept saying was I can get a manager. What was really infuriating was when we said we did not want to eat at this table, but to eat at a table in the dining area of the restaurant (which is what we were waiting to be seated for), she responded with: It&amp;#39;s Mother&amp;#39;s Day and you&amp;#39;re going to have to wait a really really long time to be seated. At that point we asked to speak to a manager. <br&gt;We waited and waited for a manager, the nice gentleman who was waiting our table earlier came by to check on us, he asked if a manager was coming, and he was very helpful. Ten minutes later we got another table, but the manager never came to talk to us, never diffused the situation or came to here our complaint, just ignored the problem and offered a different table (which we should have been seated at to begin with). Had the manager came he would have known that the table cloth was dirty, that his associate needed a lesson in customer service, and that we were dissatisfied with our visit before we had even ordered our dinner. <br&gt;We were seated and greeted by a waitress who was filling in for our waiter who was on a break. She took our orders and introduced our waiter shortly afterwards when he returned from his break. Our food arrived and my order was wrong. I asked for no bacon, because I don&amp;#39;t eat bacon, and she even repeated my request when I ordered, but of course my meal came with bacon and I had to send it back.

They have about 40 different types of cheesecakes. It was hard to choose since there were so many. We ended up ordering the Godiva Chocolate and Red Velvet Cheesecake. When the desserts came to the table they looked amazing. I first tried the Godiva one. It was very rich and creamy which made it so good. The red velvet was also really good.
