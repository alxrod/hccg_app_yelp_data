First, many of the customers were not wearing masks when walking around the restaurant. In fact, they didn&amp;#39;t even have masks at all. I understand this may be beyond the control of the restaurant and management staff, but I just want other potential customers to be aware as many other restaurants and businesses in the community are being very strict with not allowing those without masks in. We waited patiently for a table and when we were sat, the seats of the table were not cleaned well. There was grease and crumbs on the booth seat. This is disappointing considering the importance of proper sanitization with COVID. Second, we weren&amp;#39;t given bread before our meal and had to ask our server for it. Then when our food came out, much of it was cold. At that point, we didn&amp;#39;t bother sending it back because it was close to closing and we were just pretty hungry.

I had to pull off most of the breading to even see or taste fish. The fish was extremely small and thin and over cooked. Some pieces were hard to chew. Tartar sauce was good though.. This meal was not worth the price at all. I felt completely ripped off.<br&gt;Hubby got a burger of some sort that he thought was pretty good, nothing special though.

There is no Cheesecake Factory where we live, and we were skeptical going due to some of the reviews, but we decided to give it a shot. It was a busy Saturday night, and I knew they&amp;#39;d be busy and I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting 5 star service. But I was expecting better than what we got. First off, the server forgot our sons drink but brought ours out. We had to ask him twice to bring our sons juice out. Biggest rule when there&amp;#39;s kids at the table...take care of the kids first. We as adults can wait, but my 3 year old luckily had just taken a nap and didn&amp;#39;t freak out too much. We waited about 10-15 mins from the time we sat down to the time we finally got our sons drink. He was drinking my water while we waited. But our server seemed busy so I cut him some slack. Then my son said he wanted pizza. He was hungry, so this is where he started losing patience. We asked the server to get our sons order in right away while we looked at the menu. We also ordered our appetizer at the same time. We had some questions about the menu that our server had no answer to. Granted it is a big menu, and I think he must have been new-ish. But I feel like he kind of just made up answers to our questions because he wasn&amp;#39;t willing to find out the correct answer. I couldn&amp;#39;t decide between the shrimp scampi or the Jamaican blackened shrimp. Server recommended the Jamaican shrimp so I ordered that. My husband got the Cajun pasta. Our app finally came out...no kids pizza with the app like we had asked. Our son was asking about his pizza because we had our appetizer. I thought maybe the pizza took longer than our app, but surely thought it&amp;#39;d be out before our food. 15 mins later, our food comes. No pizza. At this point our son looks confused because we have our food and he doesn&amp;#39;t have his. We thought the server forgot, but 2 mins later the server brought his pizza out. Luckily our food came out pretty quickly for how busy they were (15-18 mins I&amp;#39;d say) so we didn&amp;#39;t even mention it. Our son was just happy to have his food. Now I try my food...not impressed. The dish I got wasn&amp;#39;t terrible, but it just wasn&amp;#39;t what I was hoping for. Maybe it&amp;#39;s my fault for going out of my comfort zone, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend it. It just didn&amp;#39;t leave me satisfied. It was OK. Should have gone with the shrimp scampi!! Husband said his was okay too but he wished he had gone for the steak like he originally wanted. But we thought a 10oz ribeye was going to be a bit too small. It actually seemed like a decent size from what we saw. Then dessert. Server brought us the wrong cheesecake. Fixed it right away tho. Bill came, 100$. Now we were fully expecting to spend 100$ at least! But the service we received (and the food somewhat) was NOT up to par for a 100$ meal. Maybe if we had a more experienced server this review would&amp;#39;ve been much different. Maybe they could have recommended a better dish, and had all the answers to our questions. Maybe they would&amp;#39;ve remembered our sons drink and maybe his food would have been correctly rung in so it came out first. Either way, would I go back? Probably.

Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls are also excellent as an App.<br&gt;<br&gt;2nd. \u00a0They used to have an excellent Thai Chicken Pasta that I enjoyed but for some reason they got rid of it. \u00a0They still have some nice pasta options like spicy chipotle chicken and the pasta carbonara. \u00a0Other things I really enjoy include Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon, Fish Tacos, and the chicken and biscuits are excellent.

Low Carb Cheesecake with Strawberries<br&gt; - Yuck<br&gt;31. White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut<br&gt; - Not a fan of white chocolate with caramel.<br&gt;30. Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake<br&gt; Coffee in dessert is not my thing<br&gt;29. Tiramisu<br&gt; I&amp;#39;ll stick with the original, and I don&amp;#39;t really like coffee in my desserts.<br&gt;28. Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake<br&gt; Not very good<br&gt;27.

White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle<br&gt; This one is ok, but again, not a fan of white chocolate<br&gt;24. Adam&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple<br&gt; Not bad, but they have better<br&gt;23. The Original with Cherry Preserves<br&gt; The original is good, and cherry makes it a little better<br&gt;22. Craig&amp;#39;s Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake<br&gt; I like carrot cake, but this one is a miss<br&gt;21. Key Lime<br&gt; I like it, but it&amp;#39;s a weee bit tart<br&gt;20.

Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake<br&gt; This is a good one, worth trying.<br&gt;17. Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake<br&gt; Reminds me of banana cream pie, but better<br&gt;16. Pina Colada Cake<br&gt; Different take. I feel like I&amp;#39;m in the islands<br&gt;15. Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake<br&gt; Love me a turtle in any way. This is a good option<br&gt;14. Vanilla Bean Cheesecake<br&gt; For something so simple, it works. \u00a0Tastes like rich vanilla ice cream.<br&gt;13. Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel<br&gt; Apple Pie Cheesecake. \u00a0It is good<br&gt;12. Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake<br&gt; This is the only white chocolate cheesecake I actually like<br&gt;11.

This restaurant is a great choice for any occasion.<br&gt;<br&gt;Another review from one of my 8th-grade students...<br&gt;<br&gt;Pros,<br&gt; the food was good,<br&gt; the building&amp;#39;s design was realty cool<br&gt; the people who worked there were really nice. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;Cons, <br&gt;there wasn&amp;#39;t a lot of lighting,<br&gt; confusion with the employees, \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt; The Cheesecake Factory at Westroads mall is known for their cheesecake, hence the name. Just because it is all about cheesecake it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that is all they serve. They have a variety of lunch and dinner items. The building is a dimly lit place with cool artwork decorating the walls. I think the restaurant is Egyptian themed but I am not sure. <br&gt;<br&gt; When I went to The Cheesecake Factory for the first time I didn&amp;#39;t have the best experience. I got there on a Sunday at about 3:30. It was surprisingly busy at this time. I have not gone on a different day other than a Sunday so I don&amp;#39;t know if it is that busy every day. The time I arrived was the period in which they were switching shifts. So our waiter got confused. Even Though they were having some problems finding who was supposed to serve us, the employees were very kind and tried their hardest to fix the mess.<br&gt; unfortunately, it was just a lot of waiting. When I came I was just there for the cheesecake. Let&amp;#39;s just say I was very impressed. My family and I all ordered cheesecake to share with each other. The only other thing I ordered was a smoothy. The cheesecake tasted really good. It was rich and was everything cheesecake should be. My favorite was the white chocolate raspberry. On the other hand, my smoothy was not that great. It lost its flavor and tasted like ice with some mango. Even Though I didn&amp;#39;t have a fantastic time, I think it is still a good place to go for a treat. <br&gt; <br&gt;This is definitely not a restaurant for people on a diet. It is nearly impossible to resist such good looking food. Obviously, cheesecake isn&amp;#39;t very healthy, but it can&amp;#39;t hurt to have some every once and awhile. The only thing that really bothered me was that they didn&amp;#39;t have much for lighting. It was hard to adjust after coming from a sunny day.

The problem is that the menu is so huge that many items are dumped and replaced with new entrees. I have had so many favorite dishes in the past, but most are now gone! I was currently unimpressed with my last two trips because the new entrees only left me wanting some of my old favorites. Maybe, the Cheesecake Factory should sell the retired recipes in a cookbook because they are going to need the revenue growth someday soon! I can remember when people waited in line for almost an hour to be seated at this restaurant. Days gone by...... I would be interested in hearing other people mention a recipe that has been retired and is missed! In addition, do not even try to order the Strawberry Shortcake desert.
