Their Monte Cristo is amazing .. the Monte Cristo is my favorite sandwich and only a few places in town make it right. The Factory&amp;#39;s is my favorite. And the Fried Chicken and Waffles Benedict ... a Factory original mashup of poached and Hollandaise-covered poached eggs with deep-fried chicken strops on top of a Belgian Waffle. And their maple-butter syrup ... man, I could drink this glorious stuff. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;On our most recent brunch, we cheated a bit and ate off of their lunch menu. We started with the Egg Roll Sampler: Crispy Cuban (AMAZING, my favorite!), Firecracker Salmon, Tex-Mex, and Avocado. They make epically good egg rolls. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;For the main course, I got the Crispy Pineapple Chicken and Shrimp. It&amp;#39;s a little sweet, a little savory, and a lot of yummy. My wife got the Chicken Parmesan &amp;#34;Pizza Style&amp;#34;: Breaded chicken covered with marinara and cheese; it has a big serving of angel-hair pasta with creamy Alfredo sauce. \u00a0Both are awesome, but my wife&amp;#39;s Parm has the advantage of being real filling ... the lucky girl gets another meal out of it. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;Oh, yeah, they make cheesecake! Faves are a matter of personal taste, but I&amp;#39;ve never had one that is meh or bad. I love them all, but the ones that have a special place in my heart are Adam&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, Reece&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Chocolate, Craig&amp;#39;s Crazy Carrot Cake, Tiramisu, and Peppermint Bark. <br&gt;<br&gt;Again, go for Sunday Brunch ... a relaxing way to enjoy The Factory.", "rating": 5, "date": "10/15/2017"}, {"text": "At 3pm I tried to make a reservation for 7 people for Friday night at 6pm.

After two bites I was just over it and I couldn&amp;#39;t eat any of the rice. The brown rice I got soaked up every bit of sauce. I felt like I was putting spoonful of salt in my mouth. I picked some of the proteins off that wasn&amp;#39;t covered in the sauce. Good thing they kept refilling my cup of water cause I was really thirsty with the saltiness of the food. <br&gt;<br&gt;Another great thing was the bread.

I couldn&amp;#39;t eat the bun and whatever the sauce was on the bottom was ruined. Sadly, even getting off all the lettuce, the flavor was still there.

Our server, Richard, comes over and as I ask him for a box and he stares down at the meat I had cut and asks me if i wanted it heated up more because it looked really pink. He took my plate back to heat and package it but came back and told me that him and a few others decided to remake my whole meal because the meat I had ordered wasn&amp;#39;t prepared the way I asked (medium rare). The meat itself was fantastic and I had no problem taking what I had not finished but they decided to send me back to my hotel with a fresh steak knife, fork, and a whole new medium rare rib eye with mashed potatoes and green beans!!!! Living in San Francisco my whole life I have never received this kind of treatment from anyone. Absolutely wonderful. The people are easy to talk to, the food is beyond amazing, and most importantly the people working to make your customer experience really care for you.

This was one of my worst dinning experiences I have ever had. My husband and I went to this Cheesecake factory with his parents and man did things go horrible awry.<br&gt;<br&gt;First off, I want to point out that we are big fans of the Fashion Place Cheese Cake Factory (will review later) so we have come to expect a level of service from this franchise. Our dinner started off with an extremely long wait to be seated (to be expected at any Cheese Cake Factory) the major issue was the fact that the restaurant was not very active the night we were there (Sunday). After finally being seated we were shoved into what seemed to be the back of the restaurant. The lighting at our table was extremely dim and we were hardly able to read our menus. All things up to this point were forgivable. <br&gt;<br&gt;Things went terrible down hill when our two year old son was playing with his drink. The cup he had seemed to lose its integrity as he was drinking it and decided to give way all over the table (not there fault). Dripping with drink we began to try and scramble to find some type of help from the service at the restaurant. This is where our nightmare continued. After many failed attempts at gaining the attention of multipule waiters and waitresses. I decided to ask the help of a waiter and his response was that he would come immediately after he finished the table he was working on. But after completing the table he completely forgot the promise he had made and even after our attempts to draw his attention he acted as if we were invisible. After he left I tracked down a bus boy who finally came and helped us clean up our table.<br&gt;<br&gt;Next, I feel because we were stuffed in the back of the restaurant our waiter seemed to have forgotten about us. He never seemed to come and check in on how things were going and even after we complained about our lack of drinks his remedy was to bring each of us triple drinks to make sure we were satisfied (which took up to much space on our table and created a new problem with our two year old) the best part was he brought us the wrong drinks. <br&gt;<br&gt;Lastly, the time on the food took an exuberant amount of time longer than expected. Normally I would plan on one hours worth of time but our food took double (solidifying the feeling that we had been forgotten).

I had the best lettuce wraps I have had here one time. I also had one of the worst cheesecake factory salads I have ever had at this location. <br&gt;<br&gt;But what has been really hot or cold has been the service. <br&gt;<br&gt;On a recent visit our waitress was hardly a waitress at all. It took over 10 minutes for her to come and introduce herself or give us water. After about another 10 minutes, she came by again and said &amp;#34;Sorry I don&amp;#39;t have any time I have other people I have to help that are very needy&amp;#34; so... maybe the Queen of England was also there and we were just chopped liver compared to that? Not really sure what that was about because we were paying customers too. <br&gt;<br&gt;OH WELL. We finally ordered. I ordered a lunch size chicken salad... well they brought out a huge salad and I asked if it was the lunch size and the girl who brought it out assured me that it was the lunch size. Well they forgot the dressing, and it took another 5 minutes to flag down a worker to get dressing. So okay I was a little upset but I got over it. The salad was fine, nothing amazing. I have had better at other locations. Well fast forward to the bills... and they had charged me for a full dinner salad. I told my waitress I only had a lunch, and she said that they gave me a dinner size. I protested and said it was unfair to charge me for something I didn&amp;#39;t order. She eventually agreed and only charged me for the lunch size, but it wasn&amp;#39;t without a big hassle and without her making me feel like I was the most demanding person in the world. I really just wanted to pay the price for what I ordered. So that experience wasn&amp;#39;t good. <br&gt;<br&gt;BUT the next time I came a few days later, I had one of the nicest workers serving me ever. He was so attentive and checked on me the perfect amount of times. He made sure I always had water and that I had all the things I needed. I had the mushroom chicken lettuce wraps and they were simply delicious, fresh, and a great deal. It was about a 100 times better experience. <br&gt;<br&gt;OVERALL..... I mean I think the food is pretty good or I wouldn&amp;#39;t keep coming back. It isn&amp;#39;t the best food ever, but it is open late, and there is a huge menu so it pleases pretty much everyone you come with.

We were there to celebrate family members who were going away for 1.5-2 years, doing service work. The representative told us it would take an hour to get a table (on a Tuesday night), and it was fine. Our ringer notified us at about 7:45pm that our table was ready. <br&gt;<br&gt;We initially asked for a table for 15, but ended up asking for 18. When we got to our table, it was pretty tight, so my brother cleaned a table and a few chairs and added it to ours (so we could fit). We ended up with 20 people. After this happened, one of the waiters came up to our table and told us that we weren&amp;#39;t supposed to do that. Then, he told us how wrong we were to do that. He, then, went to tell a manager named Josh who came out and yelled at us in front of everyone. So embarrassing! He yelled, &amp;#34;You guys said 18 and now there&amp;#39;s 20! What you&amp;#39;re doing is making another family wait longer! You&amp;#39;re also taking a table away that should&amp;#39;ve been cleaned up for someone else!&amp;#34; EVERYONE who was in the restaurant just stared at us. He was so unprofessional at handling a situation under pressure, and both of these guys (Josh and the male waiter with glasses) treated us like we had stolen money out of their cash boxes! <br&gt;<br&gt;I sat there feeling uneasy about the situation, and I went to find the General Manager (Mike). As one of the managers at the restaurant, Josh should&amp;#39;ve felt good that we were bringing in business! We were buying dinner and desserts for over 20 people so we were paying for the service charge as well. Since I don&amp;#39;t believe in paying people (or a business) to treat me like crap, yell at me, and embarrass me in front of other paying customers for a SERVICE (and the GM wasn&amp;#39;t there), I went looking for another manager. I found Cindy and she was amazing! She told us we were ok to sit there. In fact, she cleaned up another table and moved things around so my entire family could all fit. Our waiter (Ethan) was truly kind and easy going. He was aware of the situation and did his best to make it better! He delivered the best possible service that a waiter could offer. If it wasn&amp;#39;t for Ethan or Cindy, the night would&amp;#39;ve been HORRIBLE!<br&gt;<br&gt;Between the horrible interaction we&amp;#39;ve had with Josh and an unknown waiter, and the wonderful help and true customer service from Cindy and Ethan we&amp;#39;re giving this restaurant 2-stars.<br&gt;<br&gt;UPDATE (2 weeks later 8/25)<br&gt;I contacted their GM (the next day) to inform him about Josh&amp;#39;s actions, and he apologized and said he&amp;#39;d send a letter to me as a &amp;#34;formal apology.&amp;#34; Well, \u00a02 weeks later and still no word. Their customer service isn&amp;#39;t about the customer. It&amp;#39;s about their bottom line! Don&amp;#39;t spend your hard earned money here.

My last few experiences here have been disappointing enough to want to write this review. We went around 8:30 on a Friday night with a larger group (5 adults and 5 kids, two of whom are smaller). We were told the wait would be 45 minutes, which makes sense on a Friday night. We told the hostess we had a party of 10 and needed that to include two high chairs. They gave us our number and we waited....and waited.....and waited. Finally after an hour an a half we asked the hostess how much longer it would be. She told us we were getting close and that a certain party had to leave before we could be seated. All this would have been fine if the service and food had been decent. When we were taken to our seat we were short both chairs and high chairs. The person seating us said our booking had been listed for 8 people. We told him we couldn&amp;#39;t all sit and he shrugged and walked away. We had to flag someone else down who told us we couldn&amp;#39;t scoot the open table next to us over because they were about to use it. They wanted all 10 of us to sit around two four tops scooted together. We finally were able to get someone to allow us to move the additional table and then they had to go pull two high chairs out of a storage closet to get our kids seated. The waiter then brought us water and we ordered drinks. He shorted us a water for one of the kids so I asked him for an additional water and we ordered drinks besides that. We had enough time during the seating wait to know exactly what we wanted to order, but it was almost another 25 minutes before he brought out the drinks and bread and at that point he still forgot the water for the kid he missed in the first place. I asked him for it again and we were able to order our food. We were on two checks and just on our check we ordered well over 100 dollars worth of food (more like $150). Of that only one of the dishes was even half decent, which was the Buffalitos. We ordered factory nachos and they took so long to come out that the entire plate was soggy and cold. We also ordered Chicken Bellagio and one whole breast was nothing but fat and gristle. There was also some weird colored fat on the prosciutto, which is usually quite good. The worst of the meals was the Factory Burrito. It was old and dry and tasted like it had been made and then sat for hours under a heat lamp. The food took so long to come out that this could have been sitting for a long time. The others who were with us also ordered Apple Juices for their kids which came out after two reminders and once we had ordered dessert. The cheesecake itself we took to go because it was so late. The 30th anniversary was half frozen and put into the wrong container so that it was completely squished. Overall what should have been a fun night out that we saved to splurge on was stressful and disappointing.

I asked her to bring us some fresh bread because the ones that the pervious server brought to us was bit cold and hard to chew. She started to &amp;#34;explain&amp;#34; (in a harsh tone): &amp;#34; all our bread are like that, i mean i could if you really want to but it&amp;#39;s gonna be the same.&amp;#34; i was like, &amp;#34;the bread is very hard and i would like to have some fresh ones. please do so.&amp;#34; She said, &amp;#34; okay fine, i will bring you some!&amp;#34; seriously, your job is to bring what customers want, not to argue with me how i want my bread!!<br&gt;<br&gt;Then we got our food, till we finished our food, she never come by refill water/check on us/ anything. few minutes after we finished, she brought us the dessert menu but we decided to just skip it and asked her to bring us the check.<br&gt;<br&gt;When my boyfriend got the check, he asked me, &amp;#34; please tell me what does she mean?!&amp;#34; he handed me the bill, the server circled the tips section and wrote a big &amp;#34;thank you!&amp;#34; right next to it. we both felt confused and uncomfortable, &amp;#34;who would just circle the tips section? for what? to tell/ remind us that we need to tip her????&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;so my boyfriend went to talk to the manager, the manager of that night was a hispanic lady, she explained that the server circled it because not everyone knows to pay the tips, they circle tips on every single customers bill. my boyfriend said, &amp;#34; did you check? because i really don&amp;#39;t think she will circle the tips section on American customers&amp;#39; bills.&amp;#34; by the way, my boyfriend and i are both international college students (asians) but i don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any communication/ language barriers that we had with the server or the manager. my boyfriend said to her, &amp;#34; well this is not a comfortable situation, i felt that she is asking and reminding me for the tips.&amp;#34; The manager just acted like it&amp;#39;s not a big deal and said, &amp;#34;oh sorry you felt offended, i will talk to her. you don&amp;#39;t have to pay the tips if you don&amp;#39;t want to.&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;We both live in the US for over 5 years, and this is the first time i learned that &amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s a common thing that servers circle tips section to remind customers to pay the tips.&amp;#34; We left the restaurant that night so upset and pissed, not only because of the server but more the manager.

The other waiter seemed overwhelmed and you could tell immediately he was not up for the task. He was all over the place.

Then we noticed 2 girls that had walked in front of us all and looked like they were going to sit in the bar area so the gentleman in front of us let them know that there was a line for the tables and they told him that the restaurant had told them there is no line and that it was first come first serve.

When a table came open the couple in front of us beat the girls too it. So the girls sat at a table where two people had not even stood to leave yet. I asked the girls to allow my wife and I (who were holding a baby this whole time) to have the table because as we discussed earlier we had been waiting for a good half hour longer than the girls had.

Sadly the table next to me had a different problem with the quality of her order. \u00a0The waitress reordered the dish. \u00a0When the waitress looped back around, \u00a0the other patron explained she might just be interested in something else. \u00a0In a huff the waitresses tells the lady, \u00a0to basically make up her mind because if she doesn&amp;#39;t want the replacement dish she needs to hurry up and cancel the order she submitted. Thanks a bunch. \u00a0On a first time trip to Salt Lake City and the state of Utah, \u00a0my daughter and I now have a miserable experience to remember. I tried to use it as a teaching experience. I explained to her that this young lady either was really bad at her job or was really having a bad day. \u00a0I went on to share almost by default I tip 20% of the check amount. \u00a0In cases where the kitchen messes up I don&amp;#39;t penalize the server. \u00a0In this case I explained that on the little check we had of $30 and some change I paid $31. When the manager asked did I need change I said no. \u00a0#unbelievable We should have gone to IN and Out Burger.", "rating": 1, "date": "2/19/2016"}, {"text": "I like the location and ambiance but every time I come here I leave disappointed in the food.

We ate lunch here around 1:30 pm on a Saturday and there was a 20 minute wait. The server was slow to take our order and slow to bring our check, but the food came quickly and it was prepared well. I enjoyed the cold summer rolls which contained shrimp and asparagus in a rice wrapper as an appetizer. I ordered Sheila&amp;#39;s cashew chicken salad (lunch size) and it turned out to be a very large portion. I wish they used more salad dressing, but the quality of chicken strips was very fresh and tasty. I liked the amount of cashews in the dish. My husband ordered two excellent alcoholic beverages--a mai tai was his favorite as it was large and boozy. The second drink, a margarita, was ok but the mixer tasted of artificial lime powder. I enjoyed a strawberry lemonade, which was decent, but nothing special. My husband&amp;#39;s entree, the lunch-sized shepherd&amp;#39;s pie was too salty. Tasted like it was made with french onion soup mix. We took home half and diluted the leftover with more potatoes so it was more edible.
