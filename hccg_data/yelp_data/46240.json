Other than getting dirty looks outside from more &amp;#34;posh&amp;#34; people going into the mall at Keystone at the Crossing, I would say my experience was better than expected.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our server, Howard, I believe, was pretty great. We didn&amp;#39;t have to wait for too long, and he seated us in a booth. Our server took our drink orders right away. He had named off their draft beers for me. I don&amp;#39;t remember the brand of what I got, but he had me at &amp;#34;cream ale.&amp;#34; The ale was excellent! We also indulged in the wonderful crusty bread that was on the table. I think one was sourdough, and the other was Pumpernickel. \u00a0We were brought a second basket at one point, too. <br&gt;<br&gt;The server was patient as we perused the large menu. It was both helpful and guilt-inducing that the calories were listed next to each item. The others in my party had a side salad, the bacon cheeseburger, and the seafood wrap on the skinny menu. It all looked really good! \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;I had the veggie burger and fries from the regular menu. I thought about going for the skinny version, but, hey, it was my birthday, so I thought I would splurge, even though it was an enormous amount of calories for something I&amp;#39;d assume was healthy.<br&gt;<br&gt;The veggie burger patty easily crumbled, but it was large and appeared to have been made in-house. It was one of the better veggie burgers I have had. The bun was great, and the burger came with lots of toppings including avocado and pickles. I realized later that the aioli I didn&amp;#39;t want was on it, but it wasn&amp;#39;t a huge deal. The sandwich was already cut in half and held together with toothpicks. Our server also got a cup of mustard for me on request.<br&gt;<br&gt;The fries were really delicious! Crispy, not overly salty. \u00a0Had I a bigger appetite, I could certainly eat quite a few more of those. \u00a0I took half of my meal home as it was. It would be nice to just chill here over fries and beers sometime though. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;The waiter brought me a cute little complimentary fudge sundae with sprinkles and whipped cream. \u00a0It even had a lit candle in it!

Luckily we only waited 10 minutes but by the time we left there were 50+ people in the entryway waiting their turn.<br&gt;-My group was 7 people and they put us in a booth w/ 3 people to a side...and one random chair on the end (that was me). I felt like I was in people&amp;#39;s way all night.<br&gt;-Their menu is huge, for better or for worse. Lots of options, but also not great if you&amp;#39;re a semi-indecisive person like myself. <br&gt;-Also, those portions. They consistently rank on the nutritionist nightmare lists w/ all the calories in those dishes. I try to eat in moderation and I feel like that&amp;#39;s a difficult task here.<br&gt;-The name for the lower-calorie options is Skinnylicious. Why can&amp;#39;t it be called Healthylicious? Just looking for less gargantuan portions here, people. <br&gt;<br&gt;BUT, my skinnylicious veggie burger and green salad was a solid B+. I&amp;#39;ve had better veggie burgers, but it sufficed. I wished the dressing had been on the side, but I should&amp;#39;ve requested that. And the avocado roll appetizer was yummo :)<br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, I would much prefer heading somewhere w/ more reasonable portion sizes and yummier food.

Eventually I got one water from my waitress and one water from the waiter about 10 minutes after ordering. We ordered the Crab and Artichoke dip. It came out and it tasted terribly....more like canned tuna. The bread that came with it was rock hard and not hot. We sent it back and the manager came over.

If you like the camping original, you&amp;#39;re going to love this piece of cheesecake! The chocolate cheesecake with the mallow melted over it is absolutely phenomenal.<br&gt;<br&gt;OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake: Definitely one of my favorites. The Oreos are mixed into the cheesecake and they add a delectable crunch!<br&gt;<br&gt;Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake: Moist layers of red velvet cake and their original cheesecake covered in cream cheese frosting. How can you not love this?<br&gt;<br&gt;Reese&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake: Peanut butter. Chocolate. Fudge cake. Caramel. Hi. This is a Reese lovers DREAM.<br&gt;<br&gt;Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake: I am more of a chocolate eater, but this banana cream cheesecake topped with Bavarian cream and fresh sliced bananas hits the spot on a summer day.<br&gt;<br&gt;Adam&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple: Mom sent me an entire cake of this and I had no problem finishing this creamy cheesecake swirled with caramel, peanut butter, Butterfinger, and Reese&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Cups.<br&gt;<br&gt;Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake: Not my favorite because I am one who loves a rich dessert, but for those of you looking for a more light piece of cheesecake that&amp;#39;s easy to finish, this caramel cheesecake if your go to.<br&gt;<br&gt;Tiramisu Cheesecake: I love tiramisu and I LOVE cheesecake. Mix these together and you&amp;#39;ve got one hell of a slice of cheesecake. Another coffee flavored piece, so I love! <br&gt;<br&gt;Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake: Wow. If you&amp;#39;re a coffee drinker this cheesecake is for you. The rich brownie and Kahlua cheesecake, topped with chocolate mousse and chocolate ganache was a real treat in my coffee loving mouth.<br&gt;<br&gt;Chocolate Chip Cookie-Dough Cheesecake: Probably one of my favorites so far. Creamy cheesecake loaded with cookie dough. SO FREAKING GOOD.<br&gt;<br&gt;Chocolate Raspberry Truffle: I actually meant to order the white chocolate raspberry truffle when I ordered this one. It was good, but I am not a fan of chocolate and raspberries so it wasn&amp;#39;t my fave. I would like to try the white chocolate for sure!<br&gt;<br&gt;Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake: If you love fruity desserts this is a subtle blueberry cheesecake that is a great end to a meal.<br&gt;<br&gt;Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake: A delicious heavy cheesecake with caramel and fudge topped with caramel turtle pecans and chocolate. It was good but not my favorite!<br&gt;<br&gt;White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake: Now don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, this cheesecake was delicious, but probably my least favorite of all I&amp;#39;ve tried. It&amp;#39;s a rich slice of cheesecake swirled with macadamia nuts and caramel with a blond brownie crust. If ya like nuts, give it a try!<br&gt;<br&gt;White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle: If you&amp;#39;re looking for a piece of cheesecake that is heavier on the cheese than the cake, then this is your slice of heaven. Swirled with white chocolate and raspberry, this piece of cheesecake was sweet at the beginning and tart at the finish. Delicious!<br&gt;<br&gt;I have also tried the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Parmesan crusted chicken served over pasta with mushrooms, peppers, and onions in a spicy New Orleans sauce.

I refer to them as the Factory due in part to it being their name but also because if ever there was a place that should be known, revered and respected for the crafting of specialty cheesecakes, it is CF !!!!! What can I say???<br&gt;<br&gt;How do describe it? Do I talk about the special twisted frosting on the backside of the cheesecake that sometimes I like to dip my fork into, grab one on the end of it and eat it in little tiny bites before diving into the cake? ?? Or do I discuss the delightfully appreciated marriage between red velvet cake, complete with the perfect amount of moist, and the cheesecake itself, which is creamy, soft yet sturdy and plain old beautiful??? <br&gt;<br&gt;Do I tell you when I get cheesecake from the Factory, I indulge until I have overdosed and then get mad because even though I almost always save some for later, it&amp;#39;s never enough??? I guess I could say how long I would be willing to stand behind the counter of cheesecakes, watching them taunt me with all their choices, and wait for them to box up my red velvet....i would do it for an hour. I would literally wait in line for an hour for a piece of Red Velvet Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake. Yes I would and no I have not ever done it; I&amp;#39;ve yet to need to. <br&gt;<br&gt;But I would. <br&gt;I would go get some right now if I worked across the street. How do people work at Keystone at the Crossing and not find themselves tastebud-diving into a slice of cheesecake. I can only imagine that ALL their other choices of cheesecake are equally as heavenly as the red velvet, but I can&amp;#39;t say for certain that I will ever know. Sometimes, I can be a creature of habit. And right now, my only acceptable habitat of cheescake devouring is Red Velvet, Cheesecake Factory, Keystone at the Crossing, <br&gt;<br&gt;ASAP all the time !!!!!", "rating": 5, "date": "1/7/2016"}, {"text": "Everything here is delicious!

Weird, you say? I think not. <br&gt;<br&gt;As I was sitting around at the recent White Night event sponsored by Yelp, I was struck by the diversity of those attending including diversity of ethnicity, diversity of economics, diversity of sexual orientation, diversity of ability, diversity of status and much more. While there were certainly those who lingered with their friends, as a whole the event was enveloped by a spirit of goodness, community, fun, acceptance and a sense of people watching not out of judgment but out of appreciation and delight. <br&gt;<br&gt;As an adult with a disability who looks, shall we say &amp;#34;different,&amp;#34; I felt comfortable at this event despite my own long-existing self-consciousness that isn&amp;#39;t so much overwhelming but always sort of underneath the surface. I was surrounded by people from across all walks of life and felt genuinely comfortable there - as if in that strange and wonderful little community I had a place where my weirdo flag could fly high. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now then, let&amp;#39;s go over to The Cheesecake Factory. <br&gt;<br&gt;Located inside Keystone at the Crossing and one of two Central Indiana locations for the 185 location chain that began in 1978 in, not surprisingly, Beverly Hills. Famous for the 50+ types of cheesecakes and a menu that includes a wide range of foods including salads, pizzas, &amp;#34;glamburgers,&amp;#34; pasta, super foods and a relatively newer &amp;#34;Skinnylicious&amp;#34; menu, The Cheesecake Factory has long been blasted by health conscious folks for its high caloric desserts and excessive serving sizes on some high calorie foods. This location is nearly always crowded it seems, a preferred dining option for the Keystone area hipster crowd and gold-plated mall surfers. <br&gt;<br&gt;Going into The Cheesecake Factory is sort of like walking (or rolling) into a mini-Beverly Hills, though with a distinctly Hoosier flair tossed in. It&amp;#39;s sort of like faux Hoosier hospitality meets hipster meets &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s okay if I eat this huge piece of cheesecake because I&amp;#39;m heading straight over to meet with my personal trainer named Skippy.&amp;#34; It&amp;#39;s the kind of place where you people watch, but pretend you&amp;#39;re not. It&amp;#39;s the kind of place where you can&amp;#39;t help but look at the handbag on the table next to yours just so you can chuckle when you eye the Coach label. <br&gt;<br&gt;Okay, I&amp;#39;m exaggerating a little. <br&gt;<br&gt;I was seated at a two top, which here means being on one side of one of those half-booth/half-table set-ups. It&amp;#39;s the kind of arrangement that allows for a chair to be put on the outside of the table to allow for an extra diner. I waited a few minutes for a server, but when Mansy arrived he was fine throughout my time there. I ordered my usual unsweetened iced tea with fish &amp;amp; chips as the meal. I did get my usual refill. The order was, as Buddy the Elf would say, ginormous. The fish, in particular, was quite good. I found the french fries to be lightly seasoned yet surprisingly plain and too crisp for my liking. They also give you a nice serving of cole slaw with it and I did enjoy it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the comparison, though. <br&gt;<br&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t feel as comfortable here. It reminded me of those early elementary school days when the school jock made fun of how I held a spoon because, as I&amp;#39;ve noted, my fine motor skills aren&amp;#39;t always the greatest. Is this low self-esteem? Maybe a touch, but I also think there&amp;#39;s an overwhelming air of inauthenticity (Is that even a word? I like it.) and I found myself not feeling particularly relaxed. It&amp;#39;s not to say that everyone here is rich or beautiful or in shape or anything like that, but there&amp;#39;s a level of pretense here that made me glad I was using a gift card for an over-priced meal while surrounded by people with too much plastic in their pockets and their cheeks. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ouch. Sorry, that was a little harsh. Yet, that&amp;#39;s how it felt for me. I don&amp;#39;t hate The Cheesecake Factory. They have enjoyable outside dining, good but not great food, friendly if not exactly inviting servers and while they&amp;#39;re a splurge they&amp;#39;re not an unreasonable splurge. My meal came in at right around $21 without the tip. <br&gt;<br&gt;When it comes down to it, I suppose I&amp;#39;ve reached a point where I value authenticity, community and genuine service more than I do a hyped &amp;#34;experience.&amp;#34; Even as a customer, I want to be comfortable. I want to belong. I want to feel like you see ability rather than disability. On the flip side, I want to feel like if my disability does come into play that you won&amp;#39;t blink an eye.

I was super grateful for the gesture and excited to try their cheescake, mostly because Penny from the Big Bang Theory worked there for years and that&amp;#39;s one of my favourite shows. <br&gt;<br&gt;So we made a family date and hopped into the car to make the kind of long drive to arrive at The Cheesecake Factory. Upon our arrival it was pure chaos. There were crowds filling up both entrances and no clear way to find the hostess desk. No one greeted us or any guests as they arrived. There was zero direction from the restaurant or staff as to which way the desk or anything was. After quickly accessing the situation we decided to get our cheesecake to go, once we found a place to even order some. <br&gt;<br&gt;We made our way through the crowds, elbows out as that was the only way to keep our kids from being trampled, and FINALLY found a counter to order cheesecake to go. By the time we got to the counter I was ready to say f this let&amp;#39;s leave, but pushed passed those feelings to soldier on and do our best to salvage our family date. After looking at all of the sub-par cheesecake flavours to choose from, we settled on getting one of their original cheesecakes. Had we not choosen that option, we would have only been able to get 2 pieces of cheesecake on a $25 gift card. For those prices these cheesecakes should be, by normal standards, out of the world excellent. They fall tremendously short for all the hype I have been hearing about The Cheesecake Factory for almost a decade. Once we arrived home we even dressed up the cheesecake with whipped cream, fresh blueberries, and slivered almonds. To say they made a big impact would be a lie. I&amp;#39;m not sure anything could really improve their cheesecakes beside a complete overhaul of the recipe and their baking practices. <br&gt;<br&gt;I have not even mentioned trying to find the bathroom while we were waiting. We could not find it through the crowds nor could we find an employee to even ask until we were in their way as a few were delivering food to a table. I had to stop in their path and ask them for directions before moving. The employees were not very friendly, but I could tell they were busy. This is still no excuse though. <br&gt;<br&gt;As we made our way back from the bathroom (which was not so tidy at all) to the to-go counter, which was a crowd nightmare yet again, a manger quickly pushed through us and moved directly to the hostess stand. Not once did he look back to see if he had knocked someone over or to say excuse me or to even make an attempt at an apology. <br&gt;<br&gt;To say that this was just an off night would be nice. I wish I could believe that! I really do. But we arrived around 5:30. This is still the beginning of the dinner shift. How do I know this you may ask? Because I have been in this industry for over 17 years. There are zero excuses for any guests to be having this experience or any similar experiences at such a well known restaurant and chain. Customer service still stands where owners and employees care about their guests. Those are the businesses I will continue to support. I give thanks to The Cheesecake Factory for shaping how I view their business and customer service practices. It sure does \u00a0make this foodie&amp;#39;s list of Must-See&amp;#39;s shorter.

Due to past experiences I knew it was going to be a 50/50 chance of it being good or bad. Well, this was easily the worst experience I have ever had.<br&gt;<br&gt;So besides waiting over an hour to be seated, which I understand because of how busy they were but yet don&amp;#39;t understand how everyone that was waiting could afford their prices, we also had to wait for our waiter for about 10-15 min. before he brought us our water. Normally I&amp;#39;m a little bit more understanding, but I had to point that out because he only returned to fill our waters once out of the almost two hours we were there.<br&gt;<br&gt;Then, in terms of the food, of course one of our meals was cooked wrong. The cheese burger we received was under cooked and instead of waiting an outrageous amount of time for another one was just taken home for the dog. I was hoping the cheesecake would be the saving grace, but that was just getting my hopes up. For a place that&amp;#39;s supposed to be known for having the best it was certainty the worst I ever had.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be the first one to admit that I&amp;#39;ve had some good experiences here in the past, but the past is the past and I for one will not be giving them another chance. If there is a positive it would be that I have been able to discover other venues through the years that taste better and are cheaper. For instance, got a craving for cheesecake but don&amp;#39;t want to wait or spend an outrageous amount? Head on over to McAlister&amp;#39;s across the street. Their cheesecake is only $4.50, twice the size and tastes much better as it isn&amp;#39;t half whip cream.<br&gt;<br&gt;So, the moral of the story is that if you don&amp;#39;t like long wait times, don&amp;#39;t like spotty service and want to pay a reasonable price for your food then I&amp;#39;d suggest going elsewhere.

My friends had the lunch portion of the fettuccine and a chicken salad. I by far had the most food on my plate. While there were only 3 pieces of fish, there were a lot of fries and coleslaw. It all tasted very good and my friends would agree.

Chewing through it actually made the muscles of my jaw hurt. How is it possible for no one to notice the bread is like concrete? Ok. Wait about 25 minutes for food, it finally arrives and my entire plate is sitting in roughly a quarter inch of water. I don&amp;#39;t know if this is water from the green beans or grease from the chicken but wow, no one in the kitchen thought to pour off all that water my potatoes and chicken were swimming in? Ugh. I had to sop the majority up with napkins. The chicken was EXTREMELY soggy (probably the water) and the &amp;#34;Parmesan crust&amp;#34; was a nasty lump of brownish cheese and bread crumbs that didn&amp;#39;t have even the slightest &amp;#39;crust&amp;#39; to it. Potatoes were ok, but damn thin by the time the water absorbed into them. The green beans were those very hard snap beans, I do not care for super crunchy green beans so that was a hard pass. My date complained of the alfredo being &amp;#34;flavorless&amp;#34;, i tried it for myself and found the noodles and sauce ok but the chicken was not good. The entire alfredo dish was borderline cold by the time it got to the table, he peppered the heck out of it just to make it halfway edible. Food was such a disappointment. You know when half of the food is left on the plate, something wasnt right. Ordered the Hershey cheesecake and my date got the original, meh the Hershey was good but it has no crust at all. It is a piece of devils food cake with some chocolate cheesecake filling layered in the middle. Date said the original was ok, but said it was no better than the cheap no bake kinds at the grocery. Server was attentive but kind of strange, no reason to fault her though. We were all in all disappointed and left wishing we had spent the money at any one of the other restaurants nearby that probably had better food.

My daughters had the chicken pasta, there was lots of pasta...but barely any sauce or chicken. My dish was the salmon and chicken combo with asparagus. The asparagus was rock hard and not seasoned. The salmon had a yucky anise flavor, but the chicken was very good. Once again the portions are NOTHING like other locations! The cheesecake was very good, but for $8 a slice it should be.

Most of my reviews of places that I&amp;#39;ve visited are usually shared amongst me and my friends. But, let me begin anyway... <br&gt;<br&gt;I eat out quite often, so I typically order the same foods at the different restaurants I visit. At Cheesecake Factory, my normal order has been the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the Chicken Sliders. Now this review is not necessarily about the taste of the food but more so regarding the service and the &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; that now have a charge! This visit was a carry out on a Sunday afternoon. I ordered the above foods mentioned with a side of ranch and blue cheese dressing as I have done time and time again. On this occasion I was told that there would be a charge for one of my dressings. This had never happened before and I was annoyed upon hearing this, as I had never been charged before. I asked the host if this was a new policy and she never answered but only said that &amp;#34;her cook&amp;#34; would not give her the extra dressings unless I was charged. I ended up telling her that I would pay for the dressing (because I need my sauces!) and I would come in to talk to the manager. Upon my arrival they were fairly busy as usually so the 20 mins I was told turned into almost 35 mins for my food. Most places that I order to-go food I always have to check the bag to make sure everything is there that I ordered but with Cheesecake Factory I usually don&amp;#39;t but this time it was needed. That extra dressing I was charged for was not included, nor my bread, nor my side of fries. I couldn&amp;#39;t help but think that if the hostess wasn&amp;#39;t so busy trying to charge me a dollar for a dressing and paid more attention to the packaging of my food then this would have proven to be a better experience for me. Needless to say, I had to ask for my missing items and they were brought to me unapologetically. Overall, I felt like I was at a fast food restaurant and not one where the cost of any plate is typically $15-$20 min.

However, on all counts save one, there is nothing that brings it to a level above fine.<br&gt;Even on a Wednesday The Cheesecake Factory pulses with life. Like undersea vents every faux old-world corner is teeming with organisms. One can have a little fun playing Cousteau in the front of the restaurant whispering back and forth about the fauna. Don&amp;#39;t forget to stop by the cheesecake case to gawk salaciously at the evening&amp;#39;s options for a happy ending. The service was mercifully lacking in schmoozing and chit-chat, but rather was efficient and brisk.<br&gt;The food is well executed and of good quality. The portions are so large that in combination with the size of the booth and height of the ceiling that they foster a lilliputian perspective. I felt like I was mounting an expedition \u00a0to scale each plate, just taking bites on my way to the summit. <br&gt;The bread before the meal was a baguette that was as good as those I buy at the store, but no better. Our appetizer was a Tex-Mex eggroll, which is analogous to various southwest eggrolls that are offered in other establishments. Insomuch as an eggroll stuffed with beans, corn, and cheese can be delicate, they were delicate, properly fried, crispy, of light density, and served with a complimentary slightly acidic avocado-flavored sauce.<br&gt;The chicken-stuffed tortillas were as good as you might expect and served with a standard coating of cheese, dollop of sour cream and side of black beans. The real star of that plate were the browned and sweetened corn cakes that seemed like a cross between a tamale and sweet cornbread; the musky corn aroma melded nicely with the sweetness and caramelized exterior.<br&gt;Fish and chips are a constant boondoggle for me. I am drawn to them like a moth to flame, but I rarely get exactly what I want. I wasn&amp;#39;t wholly disappointed, but neither was I entirely satiated by the Cheesecake Factory&amp;#39;s offering. The fish was of a fine quality and the breading was crispy; it needed salt and acidity, but those were available to be added in the form of ketchup, malt vinegar, and tartar sauce. The chips (pronounced &amp;#39;fries&amp;#39; in the U.S.) were unremarkable and could have been warmer, though perhaps they simply seemed cool relative to the scalding steam bursts inside the fish. The mountain of cole slaw made standard errors; it was lacking in salt, sweetness, and acidity, and was rather bland and creamy.<br&gt;The banana cream cheesecake was almost pornographic. Something like being smothered with a heady mix of real whipped cream, banana cream, and Bavarian cream. It was garnished with fresh slices of banana whose room temperature warmth provided a nice counterpoint to the near frozen temperature of the cake. The portion was easily large enough for two people to share with shame enough to go around, but I ate it myself anyway.<br&gt;As stated before, there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with the cheesecake factory. The gaudy unpretentious atmosphere ironically creates its own level of accessible pretension. The food is fine, neither disappointing nor surprising. The genuine appeal comes from the near prurient interest in the cheesecake; much like, though more so than, the rest of the restaurant, the artless indelicacy of the enormous slices of cheesecake make for a gauche and unrefined pleasure.", "rating": 3, "date": "3/19/2009"}, {"text": "It&amp;#39;s a franchise, so what can I say?
