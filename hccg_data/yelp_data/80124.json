But I had a gift card so I thought I&amp;#39;d give it another go. Ordered take out because of the pandemic. There&amp;#39;s a section to park at where they supposedly bring out your food but I guess it&amp;#39;s only for online orders as they didn&amp;#39;t pick up when I called the number listed on the sign. So I walked up to the closed off patio area where customers line up to pick up. She brought my food and I paid and left. By the time we got home the food was nasty. The chicken avocado tomato sandwich my son ordered was a gooey, dripping mess. The bread was saturated and he had to pick out items to eat. The tomato slice was quarter of an inch thick - what the heck? The accompanying salad was average at best. My shrimp scampi was average. The strawberry cheesecake I ordered was the only thing we liked. Overall the meal sucked.

The food is somewhat overpriced, and underwhelming. Again, I can&amp;#39;t stress how much the menu doesn&amp;#39;t make sense. The avocado egg rolls are good, and the cocktails are decent.

This was my experience on a Sunday about a month ago. <br&gt;Unfortunately, I am writing to you about a disappointing experience that I had at one of your stores. We love to visit Cheesecake Factory as a family. I could name a few favorite dishes and cheesecakes we have to have almost every time we visit. My husband and I will not be visiting this particular location again. <br&gt;During our visit last night, I found my family, which includes a one year old who doesn&amp;#39;t sit still for very long and my husband, waiting for our food for an extremely long time(about 45 min) Our server hadn&amp;#39;t mentioned the long wait, but agreed to check on our food when asked. While waiting for his response, a family of four who sat down after we ordered received their food. When our server returned to tell us our food was close to done I asked to speak with a manager. Admittedly a large party (about 8-10) sat down next to us and he came over again after taking their drink order to let us know he had yet to find a manager. It took a total of 15 minutes for a manger to come to our table, which happened to be close to the end of our meal. She didn&amp;#39;t introduce her self, but I was told her name is Rachelle. She listened to my concerns about the long wait and other tables receiving food earlier. The server also had said the kitchen was slow. She did apologize, though it seemed difficult to do so. She agreed to find the source of the problem. She tried to empathize with a one year old screaming for food, though she admitted she doesn&amp;#39;t have children so she couldn&amp;#39;t really empathize. She came back to let us know our chicken Madeira, \u00a0salmon and kids chicken tenders all came out of the same area and that&amp;#39;s why it was delayed. I know they do not cone out of the same area for a fact. \u00a0She thanked us for bringing it to her attention and left. <br&gt;My frustration is on behalf of our server. Kalon G. Was a great server. He came to the table promptly. He asked if we had questions and took our order quickly. He was polite and seemed to do his job well. He came over after Rachelle left and asked if she offered us any cheesecake. No, I told him, she did not. As a former server, it is so frustrating to serve a table that has an issue out of my hands and then to receive little support from management. I have witnessed first hand, too many times, a manager offer no compensation or solution to a &amp;#34;nice table.&amp;#34; However, at the same time they will hand over all the free dessert and take appetizers off the bill for a table just looking to complain about everything.<br&gt;This poor server did everything right. Most customers would have taken their frustration out on the server through gratuity.(we did not and would not.) I&amp;#39;ve experienced this myself, when an issue isn&amp;#39;t handled by management properly to make the customer feel better and they leave it for the server to figure out on their own. Servers can&amp;#39;t offer cheesecake, only mangers can do that. It seemed that he expected her to at least offer us a slice of cheesecake for waiting so long, as we were sat ten minutes over our quoted time also. To be honest, we had planned to buy cheesecake, but after our experience and the amount of time wasted, we just wanted to leave. <br&gt;I feel this pattern with management that I have witnessed at Cheesecake Factory needs to be addressed. It affects the servers and that affects their morale. It&amp;#39;s in the best interest of the company to know that this is an issue and I hope this can help your teams to resolve these issues and to better serve the guests and employees.", "rating": 1, "date": "3/3/2020"}, {"text": "Such a great experience, Tyson was very informative and patient with my allergy needs.", "rating": 5, "date": "10/25/2020"}, {"text": "Our server Miranda was the WORST waitress we have EVER had at ANY dining establishment.

Instead, I decided to settle with the chicken piccata. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our server was very affable and was a key component to my dining experience. She was always refilling our water glasses in a timely manner, and replacing the silverware that succumbed to gravity due to the clumsiness of my dear comrade. <br&gt;<br&gt;Bathrooms were by far the highlight of my experience at Cheesecake Factory. I eventually needed to use it after the 8 glasses of water I drank, and upon entering, I was greeted with the pleasant scent of lemon that only accompanies that of an immaculately clean facility devoted for the jettison of food waste. I will definitely be making another visit to the washroom on my next encounter with &amp;#34;the Cheesecake Factory&amp;#34;. <br&gt;<br&gt;To finish off my meal, I decided to split a cheesecake with one of my dining partners. We ordered Adam&amp;#39;s peanut butter ripple. Although the slice seemed small on paper and in person, it was surprisingly filling for both of us. My only complaint is that the large swirl of peanut butter atop the sloice seemed to overwhelm the bite, both in taste, texture, and stature.

Not even a hint of comping it or asking if I wanted something else instead. Last night I got the chicken Picata. The sauce was cold and thick. The chicken was over done and barely warm.

When you come inside, you automatically feel like it&amp;#39;s going to be a good experience. \u00a0It is a warm and inviting place. \u00a0 The lights are just perfect. \u00a0It&amp;#39;s not too bright and not too dark. The colors of the whole place are vibrant. The color of the menu matches the colors on the walls. \u00a0The art on the ceilings and the walls allow you to create stories in your head, which is fun. They have a good choice of music. \u00a0It&amp;#39;s not annoying or boring; it&amp;#39;s just the right kind of music for everyone to enjoy. \u00a0The yummy smell pulls you in and makes you feel like you can already taste the food. \u00a0Cheesecake Factory is laid out exceptionally well. \u00a0There is plenty of space for walking and plenty of space for different sizes of tables. The part that I love is when you walk in, you see all the desserts they have right in front of you. \u00a0It&amp;#39;s exciting because you can start thinking about what you would want for dessert. \u00a0Also, the place is super clean. \u00a0I&amp;#39;ve never seen anything dirty or gross there. \u00a0Cheesecake Factory is a perfect place to go because you can go there with family, friends, coworkers, neighbors, a date, and with pretty much anyone you can think of. \u00a0<br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 Having good service makes people happy it&amp;#39;s one of the things that is crucial to have in all restaurants. \u00a0The service at Cheesecake Factory is perfect. \u00a0The waiters/waitresses are dressed professionally. \u00a0Even though there are 21 pages to the menu, they know everything that is on there, which is good because it saves a lot of time. \u00a0The waiters/waitresses are pleasant and attentive. They always come and make sure the customers have everything they need and make sure that they like the food they received. \u00a0Delicious bread is brought out right away, so if you are super hungry you can snack on the bread before the meal comes. \u00a0The food always comes out superfast; you don&amp;#39;t have to starve yourself or wait for it for an hour. \u00a0What makes me really feel good when I go to Cheesecake is that anytime there is a flaw in your food the manager always comes out and talks to you. \u00a0Even if you say the french fries are too crispy, the manager will come out, apologize, and remake the french fries. \u00a0Everyone that works there is extremely polite and always carries a smile on their face, which makes me happier as a customer. \u00a0All in all, Cheesecake Factory is amazing in every way, and I would strongly suggest going there, and ordering their delicious cheesecake. <br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 Every time I go to Cheesecake Factory, I&amp;#39;m amazed with the quality of the food. \u00a0The food is always so fresh you just want to keep eating and eating. \u00a0Their sandwiches are to die for. The juicy, fresh turkey on soft, fluffy bread, crisp tomatoes, crunchy lettuce, soft avocado, and crispy bacon is just heaven. \u00a0They have fried foods for those who want it, but they also offer low fat and gluten-free fare for those who would like it. \u00a0I realized a long time ago that the portions are humongous, so it&amp;#39;s fun to get a lot of different foods and split them with people. The price is fair at Cheesecake Factory. \u00a0It seems like the food is too expensive, but the meal portions are equivalent to the price. \u00a0It&amp;#39;s great to go to Cheesecake Factory for your birthday because the food is amazing and the staff members sing happy birthday to you. \u00a0I love taking my friends there on their birthdays because they get really embarrassed when the staff sings happy birthday, it&amp;#39;s really fun to watch. \u00a0It is fun to eat at Cheesecake Factory because they have fatty, saucy, greasy, naughty foods.", "rating": 5, "date": "10/3/2016"}, {"text": "I have always been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory; I&amp;#39;m not sure what it is.

That is exactly what it is, the place you go when you want good cheesecake. Unfortunately, I have yet to find any other reason to visit. I have been to the Cheesecake Factory on two separate occasions, at two different locations. My first experience was not good, but figured I would try it again since so many people seem to enjoy it. Let me first start by commenting on their menu. The menu is 15 pages long, which to some may seem like a good thing, as there are so many choices to pick from. In my opinion, the menu is so extensive that it hints at the fact that they don&amp;#39;t specialize in any type of food. My girlfriend and I had their sliders and pizza, figuring they were simple enough items that the cheesecake factory couldn&amp;#39;t possibly screw them up. I was wrong. The meat in the first (of 4)sliders I picked up, barely filled half the one and a half inch bun, and looked and tasted like it was literally heated up in a microwave and then thrown into the bun with absolutely no care at all by the cooks. The other 3 were not much to write home about, being mainly greasy and lacking taste. The &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; pizza came out and was even worse. Not only was it barely room temperature when it came to the table, but was created in such a way that it literally looked like a 2 year old had taken the ingredients and thrown it randomly on the pizza. The taste was not enjoyable, and was definitely not worth the money spent. The food ordered by our friends at the table was similarly disappointing and all agreed was overpriced for the quality. The strawberry cheesecake was the only part of the meal that was actually enjoyable.<br&gt;<br&gt;In conclusion, I do not plan on returning to the Cheesecake factory again for anything other than Cheesecake; and do not recommend to anyone who is looking a good meal. Perhaps the factory could cut down its menu, and actually specialize in a certain type of food instead of specializing in offering a large menu of low quality food.", "rating": 1, "date": "2/17/2010"}, {"text": "We went to the Cheesecake Factory for my daughters birthday last week. 3 members of our party got food poisoning. I called the restaurant to notify them and the manager basically responded that they had served 1000 people the night before and it was impossible that we got sick because of their food. I have worked in corporate American for 25 years, first of all it is possible and it is what happened to be food poisoning was confirmed by our doctor. Secondly, the manager said he would call back after investigating and he didn&amp;#39;t. Third of all, it could be a health hazard for other customers and should have been taken seriously. After reading other yelp posts about the lack of cleanliness, I am not surprised we got sick. So beware, we got 3 seafood type dishes. \u00a0I would avoid this restaurant but if you do go avoid any seafood dishes. And to the manager that didn&amp;#39;t take my call seriously, some customers will go the extra mile to let others know when they have a bad experience because we care about other people and do not want the same thing happening to them.", "rating": 1, "date": "4/18/2014"}, {"text": "favorite restaurant of alllll time! the lemon chicken piccata and the bbq ranch chicken salad...nothing like them! absolutely recommend this place to anyone! great clean place with a smiling happy staff!", "rating": 5, "date": "7/31/2014"}, {"text": "I have 25 years in customer service and I have to agree with the other reviews--this place needs to be cleaned A LOT! \u00a0When we were shown to our outdoor table, there were bird droppings on the chair! \u00a0Yuck! \u00a0I moved my chair and got another chair without the hostess asking me why! \u00a0We were there at &amp;#34;happy hour&amp;#34;. \u00a0I asked about the 2 for 1 drinks and was informed that I had to be seated &amp;#34;at the bar for this special&amp;#34; even though there were signs all over the place that at 4 pm you can get 2 for 1 drinks. \u00a0 Really--wow what great customer service!!
