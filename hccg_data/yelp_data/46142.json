The restaurant chain has locations spread throughout the U.S. and today I visited the Greenwood location for an Easter afternoon lunch with my lovely parents. Upon walking into the restaurant, my first thoughts were that the place was very nice and that it had an almost &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; feel to it. When I was presented the menu, I was a bit confused though. What was said to be the &amp;#34;menu&amp;#34; looked more like a short novel. It especially felt this way when the waitress instructed us to turn to page 8 for a list of lunch specials (page 8 was about half way through this &amp;#34;menu&amp;#34;). It was a bit overwhelming at first.<br&gt;<br&gt;After navigating through the menu for about 15 minutes, we finally decided on our orders. I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and my parents ordered the Chicken Madeira and the Carlton Salad, respectively. The Chicken Costoletta was lightly breaded, served over a creamy, white sauce and garnished with finely sliced lemon peels. It was accompanied with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. Honestly, this may have been the best meal I&amp;#39;ve had in the year 2013. It was that good. All of the flavors complemented each other very well and the chef prepared the food perfectly. My only regret is that I didn&amp;#39;t save room for cheesecake, but luckily I was able to take a piece to go.<br&gt;<br&gt;Given the fact that the place is called &amp;#34;Cheesecake Factory&amp;#34; it shouldn&amp;#39;t come as a surprise that their cheesecake is really, really good. I ordered the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake and it was one of the best pieces of cheesecake I have ever had (the best cheesecake I ever had was at One Market Restaurant in San Francisco). It was a combination of fudge, chocolate cheesecake and vanilla mouse, and yes, it&amp;#39;s as good as it sounds.

So after bowling we go to the cheese cake factory. \u00a0The place was very crowded which is understandable due to it being a Saturday during the dinner hour, so we wait and get seated. We put In our order and waited. our waiter came around 40 minutes later and finally brought our bread with our meals instead of us getting it before. I got he pasta with shrimp and the pasta was his and the shrimp was cold, so I asked if they could take it back and warm it up because I was paying around $20 for this meal. The rest of my family was done eating so they ordered our cheese cake. After this point 30 minutes later the waiter comes out with my pasta. At this point I was like &amp;#34; Can you just take this off the order &amp;#34; \u00a0so he told us he would just get his manager. The manager never came around so after we ate the cheese cake, the waiter just told us he would take it off our order for us. So I waited 1 hour to get in and waited over a <br&gt;hour to get cold food that cost $20 and sketchy service.<br&gt;If I were you I would not go because I am never going again.", "rating": 1, "date": "1/26/2019"}, {"text": "We don&amp;#39;t go here often, but when we do we&amp;#39;re always satisfied!

As a creature of habit I usually go with the Spicy Cashew Chicken (ps- you can ask for it not spicy!) Every once in awhile I will mix it up and go for the chicken pot pie smothering biscuits or one of their numerous pasta selections. <br&gt;I am also a fan of large portions. Their prices are a little steep for one meal, but when you make it two the math works out perfectly every time. <br&gt;And of course we must mention their cheesecake.

In fact, when my wife and I were having trouble deciding where to go, I said, I got it, follow my directions(she&amp;#39;s driving). She gave me a funny, but curious look. So off we go. We get to Greenwood Park Mall and says, &amp;#34;hmmm, have we been here before. I said no and then she guesses Cheescake Factory, because we have been to the Fridays there a dozen times.<br&gt; \u00a0We enter, I&amp;#39;m surprised by the size, especially it&amp;#39;s ultra-high ceilings. A hostess is right there, she asks how many and I tell her 2, then ask her &amp;#34;Is there bar seating?&amp;#34; She replies yes, I ask if we seat ourselves, she says yes and we head that way.(9 times out of 10 we sit in bar areas at places like this-primary reason-no kids around). My wife usually prefers booths and we found an open one and sat down. A waitress shows up promptly and says with a distressed look on her face, &amp;#34;Did they seat you here&amp;#34;? I reply, &amp;#34;No, the hostess said it was self-seating in the bar&amp;#34;. The waitress replies, &amp;#34;only for those sitting at the bar&amp;#34;. (I never hinted to the hostess I was looking for 2 bar stools at the bar). So I explain, &amp;#34;Oh, this is my first time hear, I didn&amp;#39;t understand that. So then, can we sit here?&amp;#34; She says, &amp;#34;I guess, but it needs to be wiped down&amp;#34; in a fairly unfriendly manner. I said, &amp;#34;That&amp;#39;s fine, it just needs a quick wipe&amp;#34;, joking that the &amp;#34;last people here were pretty clean&amp;#34;.<br&gt; \u00a0So, the confusion thing seemed over with, but we waited at least 5 minutes, when I reached the conclusion that between this ladie&amp;#39;s attitude and the wait to get a busboy to come wipe our table, this experience might not even get better. (cue in back of mind-&amp;#34;Big Bang Theory&amp;#34;, the episode where Penny screws with Sheldon about sabotaging his food).<br&gt; \u00a0So I decide we&amp;#39;re leaving. Well, the cheescake display is in front of us and I decide to order a whole cheescake to go(white-chocalate, rasberry truffle- MMMMMM, very, very rich)and this gives me time to ask for a manager.<br&gt; \u00a0Manager arrives, I say, &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m choosing to not eat hear for lunch today, would you like to know why?&amp;#34;. He does, so I explained how the confusion of which seats are in the &amp;#34;bar area&amp;#34; and which seats are not, which seats are &amp;#34;seat yourself&amp;#34; and which seats are not, added to a non-friendly reception from the waitress, made me lose faith in the restaurant. He then explained the design of the place, which area was bar and which areas were not (extremely strange set-up, very undefined, kind-of sectioning the bar area off, but kind-of blending the far side of the bar area into the family side). The protocol of the bar/family-side, who seats who thing, was now finally getting clearer. <br&gt; \u00a0So then, this has been a little twilight-zoney already, but the first part was nothing. I asked the mangager, &amp;#34;So, should I return to this restaurant to give it another chance?&amp;#34; He said, &amp;#34;Yes, you should&amp;#34;. I say, &amp;#34;Why? He looked puzzled, apparently nobody had ever asked him for reasons to dine at the restaurant he is managing. He sure didn&amp;#39;t have any reasons at the top of his head and gave he this funny look (the only thing it reminds me of is when my kids were little and I had to take one of their bottles away for a second). So then I express my very real questions about eating at a place where the manager can&amp;#39;t give me any good reasons to eat there. He starts getting uptight, says I didn&amp;#39;t give him a chance. So I say, &amp;#34;Ok, try again&amp;#34; and back up a step and put my arm around my wife in a &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m ready to listen&amp;#34; stance. So, he starts out by asking me a question, rehashing the seating thing. So I answer him, but he doesn&amp;#39;t let me finish my answer, interrupting me. I said, &amp;#34;You asked, let ME finish&amp;#34;. He then says, &amp;#34;You didn&amp;#39;t let me finish, you won&amp;#39;t give me a chance&amp;#34;. I say, &amp;#34;No, Sir, I gave you plenty of chances and you failed miserably&amp;#34;. <br&gt; \u00a0 This could have been the end of it, expect he walked away mumbling, then turned around, walked past me mumbling something. So, I said, &amp;#34;You know, I understated it, YOU are a failure...as a manager. My advice to you is that you should find an occupation more suited to your skills&amp;#34;. Before I got that out he muttered something else, which prompted me to wrap it up with the phrase, &amp;#34;You just plain suck at it (managing)&amp;#34;. <br&gt; \u00a0Again, the white chocolate rasberry truffle cheesecake was amazing.", "rating": 1, "date": "8/3/2015"}, {"text": "Great food, as always.
