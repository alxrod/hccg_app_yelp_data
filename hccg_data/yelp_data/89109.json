But it was honestly really frustrating watching families of 5+ being seated before us that arrived after us, with no reservation. I probably would&amp;#39;ve been seated faster if I didn&amp;#39;t have a reservation. If I hadn&amp;#39;t gotten up to check on my table I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have been seated at all.

At most we waited about 5 minutes, which in our eyes is very duable. Here is where it goes down south.<br&gt;<br&gt;Once we were seated no one ever came to us to greet us or take out order. We sat there annoyed, hungry, and sleepy for about 15 minutes before someone even came. Then when he did come, he took our drink orders and some appitizer orders and took about another 10 minutes to come back with our drinks. Mind you 6 out of 8 people ordered water the other two coke. You can not tell me that it takes 10 minutes to get some water from the tap!<br&gt;<br&gt;When the waiter finally did return with our drinks he took our order. At this point half the group took their meal togo because we were tired of sitting there playing the waiting game. It took us about 45 minutes to get our food. Which took entirely to long. We saw families sit down after us by like 30 minutes and get their food before us. While we waited, we never got any bread like the rest of the tables. We asked for some, but never reccieved any. Along with that, we had one person ask about the oil they use because of food allergys. The waiter said that he would check and get back to us and he never did. So one person in our group didnt even order anything becuase he failed to get back to us with important health related information. <br&gt;<br&gt;Once the food did come, we were ready to go. Some meals ended up being nice and hot while others cold and undercooked. My sister ordered shrimp alfredo and her shrimp were were raw and cold.

She immedietly sent her plate back, when she did the waiter caught a bad attitude with her with was not neccessary at all.

We have been back every year,since our 7th. That&amp;#39;s many anniversaries here!! <br&gt;<br&gt;This recent anniversary was our 21st Anniversary and I wanted to keep the tradition going. <br&gt;Although we do have a Cheesecake factory in Hawaii, which I need the energy, to get to Waikiki and with the very long wait, I don&amp;#39;t really visit this location back home often. <br&gt;This is why, I really look forward to February, our Anniversary. <br&gt;<br&gt;I Really do enjoy all my visits to this Cheesecake Factory location, located in the Forum Shops at Caesars adjacent to Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip far north side of the mall.

I like to see what new items are available. The loaded baked potato tots sounded tempting so I also got that along with our usual. <br&gt;<br&gt;Here is what we always order, our anniversary tradition. <br&gt;<br&gt;Fried Calamari, came with garlic dip and cocktail sauce, They make the best fried calamari, cooked just right, light and crisp. <br&gt;<br&gt;Did you know that Cheesecake Factory has Miso Salmon? <br&gt;Our entr\u00e9e are the Miso Salmon X 2, fresh salmon marinated in miso, served with snow peas and white rice. I always request well done on my salmon. The miso sauce, rice, &amp;amp; snow peas just went so great together. We enjoyed this entr\u00e9e. <br&gt;<br&gt;Loaded baked potato tots, Crispy potato tots filled with cheese, bacon, &amp;amp; green onion, served with sour cream. I didn&amp;#39;t care for this tots, I was expecting tots with the stuff separate, like nachos style. It was too rich, we didn&amp;#39;t finish this tots. <br&gt;<br&gt;We always get our alcoholic beverage and we need to make room for cheesecake.

A popular thing to do in this Roman themed mall is to visit the Cheesecake Factory. At the Forum Shops, all roads lead to the Cheesecake Factory located where the main corridor concludes at the Journey to Atlantis Show. <br&gt;<br&gt; \u00a0 It seems that the time I initially started visiting this Cheesecake Factory is older than the statues and columns that border this Roman themed mall. In a sense this is partially true considering that my visits go back long ago prior to the Forum Shops expansion when Virgin Records was the cool place to visit during the George W. Bush administration. Today, at the end of the Obama administration, the food and dining experience here is just as good as when George W. Bush was in office. <br&gt;<br&gt; \u00a0 This Cheesecake Factory is usually busy. There is quite a difference waiting here than an uninteresting \u00a0place such as the DMV. Here, patrons wait in an area with the sounds and sights of Rome. Where else can you wait for dinner while watching statues above a 50,000 gallon aquarium come to life to battle it out in the &amp;#34;Fall of Atlantis&amp;#34;? Waiting gets even better with the signature cheesecake displays at the other side of the hostess. Waiting would be even better if there was no waiting.

The tables deep inside the restaurant are envoloped in an elegant interior. On the majority of my visits including the latest, we sat deep in the restaurant. <br&gt;<br&gt; \u00a0 The Cheesecake menu is to restaurants what the nearby 50,000 gallon aquarium is to aquariums: Giantic! As soon as I saw eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta, on this visit I instantaneously bypassed around 250 other choices. Eggplant parmesan is one of my favorite dishes. I was so :-) to see it on the menu. With that said, in the past I have enjoyed commendable sandwiches including the eggplant parmesan sandwich, burgers, and a BLT. The eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta is reasonably priced at $14.95. Unlike some restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip, this is not a tourist trap. With the entree, I ordered bottomless Coke. Ahead of the dinner, the attentive waiter served us bread with butter.<br&gt;<br&gt; \u00a0The eggplant parmesan was delicious with a capital D. The Cheesecake Factory style of serving eggplant parmesan is separate round pieces bordering pesto pasta. Every bite of the eggplant parmesan covered with mozzarella cheese, fontina cheese, and marina cheese made me feel like a Roman emperor. Likewise I relished the taste of the pesto pasta. This is the first time that a restaurant served eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta. Cheesecake Factory had broke the tradition of serving eggplant parmesan with pasta under marinara sauce. Regardless, I truly enjoyed it. The dinner was so enjoyable that time went fast, and before you knew it we were leaving Rome for the Las Vegas Strip. It&amp;#39;s just a shame that I never leave enough room for the cheesecake.<br&gt;<br&gt; \u00a0 I have been a fan of this Cheesecake Factory going back years prior to holding a smartphone when Virgin Records was the attraction. This dining environment inside a faux Ancient Rome overlooking a 50,000 gallon aquarium where statues come to life to battle it out in the &amp;#34;Fall of Atlantis&amp;#34; show is exclusive. The generous menu offers several choices from the cheeseburger to eggplant parmesan. The prices are reasonable. And the service has always been solid.

Party of 11: Four adults and the rest under 21: Occasion: \u00a0B-day party. The wait time was to be an hour. \u00a0It was more like 35 minutes. \u00a0Polite front desk and friendly. Seating was prompt and without hassle. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our server - Sheena. \u00a0The epitome of exceptional customer service. \u00a0Sheena is the kind of employee that employers try to keep guarded from other employers trying to poach such employees. The kind of employee every business owner desires. \u00a0An employee that instills such a great experience on patrons/customers - that it keeps them coming back. <br&gt;<br&gt;Sheena greeted our party with professionalism, courtesy, all smiles, articulate, and just the right amount of chatter. \u00a0She came across as a seasoned server that knew the exact amount of exchange and pleasantries necessary to make everyone feel welcomed. \u00a0From taking our orders for drinks and appetizers on to the main entree and desert. \u00a0Our drinks were always topped off and our table cleared of used glasses, plates and empty bread baskets only to be replenished without delay. Not a single person had to request service. \u00a0Sheena was always one step ahead. <br&gt;<br&gt;Thinking of pepper? \u00a0Too late, Sheena is already asking. \u00a0Shredded cheese? \u00a0Too late - Sheena is already behind you with cheese shredder just waiting for your affirmation. \u00a0Question about the food? \u00a0Yup, Sheena is there with an articulate explanation of options/make-up of the entree. <br&gt;<br&gt;I remember trying to think of any additional request - but Sheena was there - one step ahead. \u00a0We were so lucky to have been served by this great person. \u00a0Such a delight to have as our server. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;She worked our table like a ballerina - with the most exquisite detail to service. From the youngest patron, a 7 year old to my mother - everyone spoke highly of Sheena&amp;#39;s performance. \u00a0The food, our drinks, deserts, everything was better due to Sheena&amp;#39;s service. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Food - Most started off with sot-drinks, while I enjoyed a Moscow Mule. \u00a0No copper mug but the Mule had a kick to it and not watered down. \u00a0For appetizers, we indulged in stuffed mushrooms, fried zucchini, calamari and artichoke? \u00a0The stuffed mushrooms were perfect and the fried zucchini was perfectly presented. \u00a0Just the right amount of crisp. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Entrees included Chicken Madeira, Four Cheese Pasta (a favorite at the table), Steak Diane Scampi Combo, Fettucini Alfredo, Chicken Caesar Salad, Fish and Chips, Chicken Littles, and an assortment of other salads. \u00a0The Chicken Littles was quite the opposite of little. \u00a0My poor niece, who probably weighs less than 60lbs got full by just looking at the mountain of food on her plate. \u00a0It was an inordinate amount - much more than the typical Cheesecake Factory portion. \u00a0The food was very good. \u00a0Of course, we enjoyed our meal more due to the great service provided by Sheena. <br&gt;<br&gt;For appetizers the selection was diverse - Snickers Cheesecake, Oreo Dream Cheesecake, 30th Anniversary Cheesecake (this is the one item I had second thoughts on - I should have ordered the Oreo Dream Cheesecake - the 30th Anniversary didn&amp;#39;t have the sugar kick that accompanied the Oreo Cheesecake), Salted Caramel - probably one of the best choices for deserts, and the Birthday Sunday for the Birthday girl. \u00a0Served with black coffee to conclude this exceptional experience. <br&gt;<br&gt;Thank you Cheesecake Factory and above it all - Sheena - just wow! \u00a0Thank you so much! \u00a0Entire family appreciate and thank you for the exceptional service. \u00a0Truly a unique experience. \u00a0That 30% tip should have been at least 50%. \u00a0Well deserved.

Very cheesy and very rich in flavor. I believe it was topped with ricotta and mixing that in with everything made the texture especially delicious. <br&gt;<br&gt;Also had the margarita pizza. The thing about that pizza is it&amp;#39;s not too heavy or greasy. The sauce is where it&amp;#39;s at and its not a splatter of tomato sauce. It&amp;#39;s smooth and hits the spot. Definitely a step up from cheese pizza, there isn&amp;#39;t much of a difference anyway so I would say to just go for the margarita. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ate an ahi appetizer, forgot what it&amp;#39;s called but it was delicious... Except it was a tad bit expensive for the amount I got. I was expecting bigger chunks of ahi but I understand that ahi is an expensive fish.

I like that this location is quite large and that there are 2 floors of seating, although it can get pretty packed on the weekends and around dinner time. The menu is extensive so ordering is a task in itself lol. Somehow though, I always revert to my favorite Miso salmon, brown rice in lieu of white. Hubby got the Mac and Cheese burger which was cooked perfectly, rich and flavorsome. The madre got the Louisiana Chicken pasta which she thoroughly enjoyed. We also had a taste of the fish tacos which were surprisingly good, the cilantro rice is one of the best I&amp;#39;ve tried. On the kids menu: chicken tenders and fries, well it&amp;#39;s chicken tenders and fries, nothing much to elaborate. The mac and cheese that my son ordered was unsavory to put it mildly. It was dry and bland with no flavor profile at all. Our server must&amp;#39;ve noticed my sons dislike as he took one bite and ceased eating altogether hahaha so he offered to get him something else, my son wasn&amp;#39;t feeling very well so he opted for the bread basket instead. Our server informed us he would have the mac and cheese taken out of the bill, we told him it wasn&amp;#39;t necessary but he insisted. A red velvet cheesecake was shared amongst us as we were too stuffed to order more. Service was cordial and timely despite the dinner rush.

I was told to tell her all the things I wanted done for the party. \u00a0Well we never saw her again. We were given one male waiter for the entire party. We were never informed that he was taking over the party so I didn&amp;#39;t know that I had to tell him all of our plans right then and there in the beginning. They brought out everybody&amp;#39;s drinks quickly. Then they went to the other table as we had two tables for a party. That table had only adults and they said to let our table order first as we had small children. So we ordered, however they never went back to the other table. My brother came over that I had to tell him all of our plans right then and there in the beginning. They brought out everybody&amp;#39;s drinks quickly. Then they went to the other table as we had two tables for a party. That table had only adults and they said to let our table order first as we had small children.

This pushed off of us getting our food for an entire hour. I had over 20 people, some of them out from out of town, many of them toddlers waiting for an entire hour for our food. My son who was the birthday boy started to cry because he was hungry. This became very stressful. Also they only gave us one later for over 20 people. They could&amp;#39;ve at least given us two waiters, one for each table. The descriptions on the menu did not fully explain what the food came with as a side. A lot of the breakfast items immediately came out with bacon. We had people in our group who are vegan and we had people who are not eating pork for religious reasons and cannot have it touching their food. So all those people had to send their food back and wait even more! By this point I was very frustrated. Going into the birthday cake, they had no idea what kind of a cake we wanted. However I had emailed about this months ago. So they had to go and get the cake ready and they lost the candle that I brought in with my sons age on it. This meant another half an hour waiting for the cake. \u00a0The service was the worst service I&amp;#39;ve ever had in my life! I was so embarrassed in front of my relatives from out of town and I felt terrible for my friends who brought their small children and the kids have been fussing at the table.

I got the French toast. Overall, it wasn&amp;#39;t bad. It was cooked well and the inside was nice and custardy. It wasn&amp;#39;t too sweet either, which I really don&amp;#39;t like on my French toasts, so that was a good thing!

Most of the dishes are served on huge white plates (more like platters). It didn&amp;#39;t seem too long for our dinners to arrive. The presentation was nice- parsley generously sprinkled around the entire perimeter of my plate. My husband thought that my dinner was small, but I only ate half of it, and took the rest home (as did he). The gumbo was good, but not traditional, in that the broth was clear, and secondly, there were big chunks of tomatoes. I thought that this is worth mentioning since I am a big fan of the traditional style gumbo with the roux (oyster bar at stations).

What I never understood is why when you have a table of at least 6 people, odds are it maybe 3 couples especially if you see there are 3 females and 3 males. maybe. so why on earth would you assume in your infinite wisdom and experience servicing the restaurant industry that one person is going to pay the entire tab? We are going to split this up b/c thats what coupes do. and instead of making this awkward for everyone involved. please ask us if we would like to split this up one 1 ticket or 2 or 3? and make this easier for everyone. at the beginning of the meal. this has annoyed me for years with large restaurants such as this. <br&gt;<br&gt;end thought: order dessert. go light on food .. split a pizza and go for the dessert!", "rating": 3, "date": "11/23/2010"}, {"text": "Very disappointed.

After being in the nearby Apple Store for about 3 hours, my friend and I decided to grab dinner at Cheesecake Factory. We were seated fairly quickly, which was great, but our seat was in a super small corner and very close to the the table next to us, so we opted to sit at the bar. This is where the trouble came in. <br&gt;<br&gt;The bartender first poured us water and took our drink order. When he placed the water down, he slammed the cups in front of us. We thought very little of it initially. Next, he delivered the drinks and walked away without saying anything about food, which we had previously told him we would be ordering. We called him back to order. My friend ordered a pasta dish and asked for extra sauce to be poured in. He replied, &amp;#34;No.&amp;#34; We were confused and actually thought he was joking, but he said &amp;#34;no you can not&amp;#34; again. She asked why and he explained that many people ask for it and it comes out too soupy and he &amp;#34;wasn&amp;#39;t about to send any food back because it was too soupy.&amp;#34; Then he called out to someone else (another employee) and walked away. He poured a glass of red wine for another customer then He came back and pointed to me and asked what I wanted to eat, but he hadn&amp;#39;t resolved the soupy pasta issue with my friend. We had decided that we didn&amp;#39;t like his attitude or the way he yelled out to someone and walked away in the middle of taking our order so we decided that we would enjoy the meal at a different Cheesecake Factory. I told him that we wouldn&amp;#39;t be eating here and that we were leaving. He took the receipt for the drinks slid it in front of us and said &amp;#34;don&amp;#39;t forget to pay for these.&amp;#34; We hadn&amp;#39;t had one sip of our drinks. We asked to speak to the manager because we didn&amp;#39;t want to walk out and have it look like we skipped out on a bill.

We quickly snagged a corner seat at the bar and were helped by Jeremy (The guy that looks like &amp;#34;the guy from Jarhead&amp;#34; aka Jake Gyllenhaal). We both ordered the fish tacos, but Jeremy suggested the plate was big and we could probably split it, which we ended up doing and didn&amp;#39;t regret it because it was a LOT.

He was quick and attentive-- perfect dinner service! <br&gt;<br&gt;The next night, we opted going straight to the bar again, and were helped by Jose &amp;amp; William. William, hands down, knows which dishes are worth getting and will steer you away from something you may regret ordering later. HANDS DOWN this guy&amp;#39;s got the menu memorized. I even was able to test his knowledge about what was in certain dishes, and he was able to answer without hesitation; and if anyone&amp;#39;s ever been in the Cheesecake Factory, you know their menus are 80-page books. He was able to suggest the Miso Salmon &amp;amp; the Veggie Salad, both of which we ordered and were NOT disappointed (seriously, order these items).

I am not sure of they were friends or mother and daughter??? <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered the Factory chopped salad that is tossed with a balsamic dressing. The salad has apples, bacon, avocado, bleu cheese, and a bunch of other yummy veggies that tie in with the dressing beautifully! As we were enjoying the salad, the two woman finished their argument and began a conversation with us! They started to recommend dishes that they like there and then were talking smack on other dishes, including the salad that we loved at this point! Anyways, they recommended the Chicken Piccatta and it was a hit with us! But watch out for the portion size! We were able to split the dish and still had a little left over. The chicken is cooked with a white sauce and capers...but we requested that the capers be left out ( I am not a fan). It comes with a size of pasta that compliments the chicken well. <br&gt;<br&gt;And for dessert, of course cheesecake! They have so many to choose from!!!! how can one make that decision??!! A few of my favs from there: The chocolate mousse cheesecake, the carrot cake cheesecake, the original flavor, and the tuxedo. You can also get the original flavor and there is a variety of fruit toppings that you can have added if you choose. <br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, this place rocks!

I was happy to find a couple microbrews on the menu, and I opted for the Hefe. The rest of our party enjoyed one of the many cocktails that the CCF offers. All of our drinks came out at the same time, and only after about 5 minutes after we ordered. I ordered the nachos minus the meat and edamame, and most of the table also ordered apps. The portion sizes on these apps was massive, and we probably could have only ordered 4 for the entire table. I was able to conquer about 1/2 the nachos and had significant help with the edamame.

Our bill was actually very reasonable especially noting how much food we got. The service was great and the location perfect for what we needed. I probably won&amp;#39;t be a CCF regular, but I will definitely be open to dining there again.

We stayed within the casino, so when they called we came running and the table was ready. Service? It was actually pretty good. I didn&amp;#39;t walk away wow-ed by the service, but it was good.

However, I think that stack of onion straws, the flatbread and the pasta could absolutely be worth it. The menu for you gluten-lovers is great. Somewhat predictable, but great.<br&gt;<br&gt; My friends eating gluten all loved their food! My fiance got a basic burger, another got the Steak Diane, one got the Kobe burger with American cheese (wrong cheese, but moving forward) and the last guy got the Mac and Cheese burger. I ordered the safest item on the menu for someone that is gluten free which is the lemon and herb chicken with mashed potatoes. It seemed safe at the time, and even though I wasn&amp;#39;t starving, I didn&amp;#39;t want to be ill for the rest of the night. <br&gt;<br&gt;Nobody complained about their food. Everyone said it was great and that they were completely satisfied with their meals. The fries looked pretty standard. I expected a little more pizazz with their fries since everything else was so extravagant, but they were simple.

Hands down some of the best chicken I&amp;#39;ve ever had at a restaurant. The best thing? There were bones in the chicken, but the large ones were removed and the chicken came right off the bone.

It was a really nice Cheesecake Factory since it was inside The Forum Shops at the Caesar&amp;#39;s Palace. This one had an outside patio for dining with a view of the pretty fish tank! Nice!<br&gt;<br&gt;For this time around, I had ordered The Incredible Grilled Eggplant Sandwich with grilled Japanese eggplant, roasted bell peppers, red onions, melted mozzarella and garlic aioli on a toasted bun with a side of sweet potato fries. I asked the waitress if she would order my sandwich with the aioli on the side. When my dish arrive, I noticed that they did not place the aioli on the side (I am thinking that the waitress forgot to note it down), that \u00a0the eggplant was cut in quarters instead of being sliced thinly. What&amp;#39;s the big deal, right? Well my Yelpers, trying to eat a chunk of an oily grilled eggplant inside a toasted bun smeared with garlic aioli and melted cheese and slippery grilled peppers makes it difficult to handle and eat. The eggplant kept slipping off my sandwich every time I took a bite. Hence, I decided to just take it off my sandwich and have a roasted pepper and cheese sandwich and eat the eggplant on the side. If they would change the cut of the eggplant, then the sandwich would definitely no be as messy to eat and enjoy, especially if you are paying like $15!<br&gt;<br&gt;I tried the Chicken Madeira from a friend&amp;#39;s plate. The chicken was very tender and juicy and the sauce was not too salty or bland, perfect! I also tried her mashed potatoes and loved that you can taste real potatoes! Definitely not potatoes out of the box and then scooped onto your plate haha. Great portion for two meals! Now that&amp;#39;s a bargain. My friend, however, ordered the plate with no asparagus and it came with it anyhow. Thus, the waitress forgot to note it down as well. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, great dining experience!

We didn&amp;#39;t get our drinks in a five minute time frame, but instead longer. It took us even longer to order and to get our food. The most irritating part, they messed up on some of the orders and didn&amp;#39;t even apologize. Since I am very carefree, I asked one of the staff for the manager. I told the manager that we weren&amp;#39;t happy and that, he had the worst staff any person can imagine.Out of all the cheesecake factory (at the ceasar&amp;#39;s forum) staff, the manager, I believe was, the only one who was decent to actually care about his job and the reputation of the restaurant. <br&gt;<br&gt;Skip this place when you are in Las Vegas.
