When I&amp;#39;m at Dadeland, 9/10 times, I choose Cheesecake Factory. One of the things I like the most about this place is the extensive menu. The ambiance is cool and easy going. The waiters, especially the ones at the bar side, are friendly and courteous. On one of our visits, I complimented the warm brown bread in the basket. Our waiter was so cool that when we left, he gave us a full loaf of the brown bread. It was a random act of kindness and so unexpected. But those are the kind \u00a0things that bring you back to a place. \u00a0I enjoy their \u00a0appetizers like the avocado egg rolls, nachos, and lettuce wraps. They have a pretty flavorful light menu that satisfies pretty much every appetite. I don&amp;#39;t have much of a sweet tooth but the variety of cheesecakes are sure tempting too. <br&gt;<br&gt;My only complaint with this restaurant is overall cleanliness especially in the bathrooms. They need to have a \u00a0better system in place to ensure all is stocked and kept clean. Every time I stop in, the garbage receptacle by the door is overflowing, some toilets are out of paper or some other area is not too clean. I really like CF but I would love it even more if that was addressed. Believe it or not, everyone notices bathrooms and when they are comfortable and clean it keeps everyone coming \u00a0back. As a matter of fact, I bet if this one thing gets better and the wait times are improved, the overall ratings will go up? Maybe?", "rating": 4, "date": "2/2/2020"}, {"text": "Haven&amp;#39;t been to one in some time so me and a few friends decided to go there. We arrived at 10:30 which is an hour before closing time. This is the only reason that comes to mind of why we had such a bad experience (I usually go to the dolphin mall branch and will most likely go only there after this). I ordered the carne asada stk medallion. Of course before that we got the bread pretty late and it was squeezed so much where you cut it with the knife it almost became a flat bread. Also a little burnt. When asked for white bread the waiter said that&amp;#39;s the only bread he has. Talking about the waiter. Can&amp;#39;t say he was completely rude, but he gave us that uneasy sort of feeling. Maybe he had a bad day maybe not, but it added to the annoying service and food. <br&gt;<br&gt;Going back to the meal. The steak was pretty good, on the other hand the fries was cold and stale as if it was taken from the leftovers of another guests plate. This was exactly the same case for my friends fries in his order of fried chicken sandwich. <br&gt;I told the waiter, he offered no apology and just said do you want rice instead. I said no. Yet another unpleasant part of us coming here. <br&gt;<br&gt;Like I said I&amp;#39;ll definitely only go to the dolphin mall branch, at least it&amp;#39;s closer.", "rating": 2, "date": "9/26/2019"}, {"text": "I love it here.

I got it topped off with shrimp and you cant really go wrong with it.<br&gt;<br&gt;The person I was with got the spicey chicken sandwich and that was also a good choice if you want something like that.

It is especially weak when I compare it to Aventura&amp;#39;s Cheesecake Factory.<br&gt;<br&gt;I had a pretty good experience at Aventura recently. Their happy hour foods were surprisingly good overall and it inspired me to try Dadeland&amp;#39;s. <br&gt;<br&gt;While the Chicken Sliders $5.50 were big and appetizing at Aventura, at Dadeland they were a joke. As you&amp;#39;ll see from one of my photos, one chicken patty was hastily ripped in half to make two sliders. One of the chicken pieces was so small, it was basically a single bite.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Portabella, Avocado, and Zucchini fries $6.95 are extremely greasy. I couldn&amp;#39;t continue eating them. The Guacamole $5.50 on our first visit to Dadeland was okay. The Mojito $5.50 was fine. The S&amp;#39;mores cheesecake $7.95 was the best dish.<br&gt;______<br&gt;<br&gt;On our second visit to Dadeland&amp;#39;s Cheesecake Factory, the Guacamole $5.50 was very unappetizing looking. It had a very obvious brown/oxidized color to it. I thought that it was only brown on the top layer, but it was brown throughout. I dug deeper in several spots in the dish and it was all oxidized. I&amp;#39;m guessing they had a vat of old guacamole and made sure to send it to anyone who ordered off the happy hour menu. To top it off, I bit into the little nub of the avocado. That was unpleasant. This time we ordered it mild and it still had a bizarre spicy taste. It didn&amp;#39;t taste like any type of chili I&amp;#39;ve tried before. It wasn&amp;#39;t black pepper either. It tasted like it had been seasoned with pepper spray (the self -defense kind) or something. Very strange.<br&gt;<br&gt;The grossest thing we ate were the Beer Battered French Fries $6.95. Avoid this dish. It was nothing like we expected. I expected beer battered fries like those that are served with fried fish at a British pub. Instead, it was like they slow cooked the hefty potato sticks in barely warm oil first. Then they battered them with a thick and strange breading and fried it at too low of a temperature. The outside of the &amp;#34;fries&amp;#34; was technically crispy, but they were somehow not tasty. I usually love fried food, but the thoroughly oil-soaked fry was a huge disappointment. <br&gt;<br&gt;I had tried the Ahi Tuna Tartare at Aventura and was looking forward to it here. The miniscule amount of tartare $7.95 was insulting. All of the tartare could fit inside one of those little plastic cups they use for ketchup. I still can&amp;#39;t believe I just didn&amp;#39;t send the dish back upon seeing it. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Happy Hour Burger $5.50 was pretty basic.<br&gt;<br&gt;The only redeeming part of this particular meal was the Oreo Dream Cheesecake $7.95. At least the kitchen doesn&amp;#39;t touch this dish. The cheesecake counter people just put a little bit of whipped cream next to it.<br&gt;<br&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t think chain restaurants could vary so much.

I&amp;#39;m not sure if Jonathan was new but he seemed quite confused with my order. We asked him to bring more bread as well. <br&gt;<br&gt;20 more minutes passed and our drinks were empty and watered down and had just then received the extra bread we had asked for. After 20 more minutes of waiting (still with empty drinks) he finally returned to the table to ask if it was okay with me that the pasta had Cajun butter on it (which is normal to the Louisiana Chicken Pasta dish), which makes the dish spicy, after I had clearly stated I ONLY wanted white sauce. No veggies, not the sauce that it usually comes with, white sauce... Obviously this was not okay with me. He returned to nowhere land or wherever it was that he kept hiding out for about another 20 minutes.<br&gt;<br&gt;We were all starving at this point and had been here for an hour already...He finally started bringing out the dishes 2 at a time.

Everything else was a total sh*t show. \u00a0I am now going to verbally annihilate this restaurant. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;1) The men&amp;#39;s room was absolutely freaking disgusting: wadded, dirty paper towels everywhere. \u00a0EVERYWHERE. \u00a0Trash cans overflowing. \u00a0Every toilet had piss on the seat and feces smeared on the bowl. \u00a0The mirrors were dirty. \u00a0AN OLD MAN WAS WASHING HIS FREAKING HAIR IN THE SINK. There was what looked like a freaking COLOSTOMY BAG ON THE FLOOR. \u00a0The minute I set foot in the men&amp;#39;s room, I felt like what any woman would feel like if she downed a bottle of vodka and a bunch of roofies and then went knocking on Brett Kavanaugh&amp;#39;s dorm room. \u00a0The raunchiest gay bareback porn I&amp;#39;ve ever seen is still not half as filthy as this CF&amp;#39;s mens room. \u00a0I hope the manager is reading this: CLEAN YOUR FREAKING BATHROOM. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;2) Our waiter was inattentive and slow the entire night. \u00a0I ordered the Southwest Chicken Sandwich and the chicken came ice cold. \u00a0I complained to our incompetent waiter that I&amp;#39;m not paying $20 (extra chicken) for cold meat, and told him to take it away and give me a hot sandwich. \u00a0After a 10 minute wait, a different (female) waiter appeared and sassed me, saying that &amp;#34;the chef says that this is supposed to be a cold sandwich.&amp;#34; \u00a0Look woman, don&amp;#39;t freaking sass me: I&amp;#39;ve ordered this same sandwich 20 damn times at various CF&amp;#39;s and the chicken is always hot. \u00a0Don&amp;#39;t piss on my leg and tell me it&amp;#39;s raining. \u00a0DONT ARGUE WITH A CUSTOMER.

There is usually a wait, but you can just head into a few stores to kill a little time. Once your name is called, service is consistent and fast. They have one of those awesome menus that you could spend hours dwelling and agonizing over. Just don&amp;#39;t (agonize) because everything is good, and you WILL go back, so can try whatever you were undecided about. The serving size is large, so I&amp;#39;d warn you not to fill up on bread, but that&amp;#39;s impossible. The hearty portions of crusty warm white bread and warm brown bread are irresistible. Although I&amp;#39;ve tried many dishes, my favorite is actually a huge appetizer, the Thai Lettuce Wraps. Grilled Asian chicken with various toppings, such as matchstick carrots, noodles, cucumbers, fresh cilantro, and sprouts. You make your own and wrap them in lettuce, and dip them into one of three super delicious sauces. I have only had the cheesecake twice.

This drink barely tasted like ginger at all. It tasted like tonic water with some seltzer. I then ordered the beet and goat cheese salad. It is located under the small plates, appetizers section, and boy is it small! The amount of goat cheese given was a joke, and the beets were cut up into tiny little cubes, very disappointing. As my main plate, I had the thai wraps. This was delicious. It is fresh lettuce leaves, cabbage leaves, grilled chicken, cilantro, carrots, bean sprouts, and 3 sauces. You build your own spring roll.

We ended up being disappointed with just about every part of the meal. First of all, a 40 minute wait in heels with absolutely nowhere to sit was terrible. The entire waiting area was a circus. It looked like the entrance to some kind of overrated night club. The hostesses were attempting to yell names over the roar of the crowd. Apparently the pagers they give you are completely pointless because if you stray out of yelling range you&amp;#39;ll never get sat. The experience didn&amp;#39;t get too much better once we eventually were seated. It was still incredibly loud at our table even though we were sitting in a separate dining area from the main restaurant. Our waitress was barely ever around and every time she was at the table she seemed like she was in a rush to get away again. I ordered the baja chicken tacos. They were so soggy that they fell apart completely every time I took a bite. Thankfully the tortilla chips I had leftover from the spinach dip actually made the dish edible. Another person ordered garlic noodles with shrimp which was just overly greasy pasta with 4 overcooked shrimp. The other people at the table were happy with their salads. Dessert was the best part but they couldn&amp;#39;t get that right either. We ordered 2 different cheesecakes which were delicious and an apple crisp that looked like ****. It was literally swimming in melted ice cream and had a huge exaggerated dollop of whipped cream in the middle. Not to mention &amp;#34;Happy Birthday&amp;#34; \u00a0written in chicken scratch on the plate. Horrible presentation. Once I got rid of 80% of the whipped cream and swam through the ice cream soup to get to the actual dessert, it was delicious.

Jose truly recommended it and even told me that if I did not like it he would gladly exchange it. Usually they bring out a basket of white and pumpernickel bread. My boyfriend, knowing we had the same taste, told our waiter to bring out only white bread. <br&gt;<br&gt;While we were waiting for our drinks and decided on our entrees, our water and bread with butter immediately came. I ordered the chicken teriyaki which consisted of chicken breast charbroiled with teriyaki sauce, served with steamed rice. My boyfriend ordered the Orange Chicken which was deep fried pieces of chicken breast covered in a sweet and spicy orange sauce. Served with white rice and vegetables.<br&gt;<br&gt;Ok so my White Sangria was delicious. Very fruity, sweet and refreshing. My teriyaki chicken was great. What I did not know is that the chicken is served with the skin which the teriyaki sauce is on it. I don&amp;#39;t eat chicken skin, \u00a0and if i known that I would have ordered to take the skin off and place the teriyaki on top of the skinless breast but it was tasty after all. I rubbed my meat on top of it just to give it the teriyaki flavor and the steamed rice had a bit of the teriyaki sauce on the side of it just to make it sweeter. I tasted a piece of my boyfriend&amp;#39;s Orange Chicken and it was great but glad I did not ordered that plate as I was not in the mood of eating fried food that evening. He said it was very good. <br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, we got in an out in a good amount of time and our waiter rocked!!", "rating": 4, "date": "7/8/2012"}, {"text": "I really enjoyed my experience here.

We get his attention and he reluctantly takes our order in a rush again. We barely get a word in and he seems bothered to answer our questions. He rushes off again. We waited about 45 minutes for our burgers and of course the order is wrong. During this time we didn&amp;#39;t have any contact with the waiter ( not even to refill water). He continues to skip over us and go to the next table. We decide to leave our food untouched and just let the hostess know that we had a bad experience and would like to leave. I asked her if she needed me to pay for the bread and she said no. We left hungry and headed to Bobby&amp;#39;s burgers which was awesome!!!. I was so disappointed because I do love cheesecake factory and have many great memories there.
