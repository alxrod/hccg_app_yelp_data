It&amp;#39;s a great location-- very accessible by walking/public transport and you can shop in the Pru before/after eating!<br&gt;<br&gt;The pasta campagna is arguably the best pasta dish they serve. To be fair, I haven&amp;#39;t tried every single pasta dish they offer, but ever since I discovered this one I haven&amp;#39;t felt the need to try any of the others. I get it every time I come here now.<br&gt;<br&gt;I also got the filet mignon one day because #TreatYoSelf. For around $30, you get a very generous portion of beef, as well as mashed potatoes and green beans. I split the steak with a friend, and even the half-portion was comparable in size to what you might get at a $$$$ upscale restaurant. I&amp;#39;m sure the quality is better at those fancy places, but honestly the steak was so tender, flavorful, and cooked just right so I wasn&amp;#39;t mad about it. I didn&amp;#39;t get a steak knife so I cut the steak with a dull butter knife and it worked perfectly fine. This was tender enough for me. Not top notch, but definitely still impressive in my opinion.<br&gt;<br&gt;I recommend the Georgia Peach if you&amp;#39;re into &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; fruity/sweet drinks, which is right up my alley. Maybe I&amp;#39;m biased because I love peach flavored things. <br&gt;<br&gt;I took one star off because the service can be suuuuper slow. Almost every time I dine in, I wait so long to order and then I wait even longer to get the check. Also the last time I went, they forgot to give us water which I thought was standard but maybe we were supposed to ask for them in addition to our alcoholic drinks.

We both had time to go to the bathroom (one at a time), chat and pick out our entire dinner plans (apps and entree&amp;#39;s) before even being greeted. Finally she came over, dropped water and bread without saying anything and again, left. We finally got to order about 10 mins later and everything seemed fine! She was very nice, but I couldn&amp;#39;t understand anything she said because she mumbled every word. We ordered avocado egg rolls with extra sauce, an old fashion burger with chipotle mayo on the side, and spicy cashew chicken with extra sauce on side (not too hard or complicated as I&amp;#39;m also a waitress, and she wrote it all down it seemed!) App came without extra sauce, which is ok we asked someone else for it since our waitress never came around or checked on us. 25-30 mins later we got our entree&amp;#39;s (this is where the 1 star for laughs comes in!). Another worker dropped off my burger (cooked perfectly!) which was slathered in regular mayo , no chipotle mayo :/ \u00a0THEN came the funny part. The girl puts down a plate of plain white rice with plain chicken on top. I was so confused, I almost told her she had the wrong order. Then she puts down all the toppings down which were all individual and says &amp;#34;and here&amp;#39;s the toppings all on the side&amp;#34;. She left, there wasn&amp;#39;t even sauce. It was plain chicken with plain rice and toppings on the side. What? She finally came back and dropped off a bowl of sauce. I asked her if she could bring everything back to mix it all together as this is not what we ordered. She brought back the rice and sauce, not the toppings. 10 mins later she brought back the plain rice and plain chicken with the sauce poured over top , what? Our waitress still never came over. Thus, it was essentially a &amp;#34;make your own dinner&amp;#34;. We came out to be waited on to have a peaceful anniversary dinner, not a parade of trying to get multiple workers attentions, every order incorrect, make your own dishes, barely seeing our waitress and no corrections by the waitress.

However, their cheesecakes are really phenomenal. They come in huge slices with mountains of whipped cream. As a whipped cream lover, I am a huge fan of the amount of whipped cream that goes onto these cheesecakes. They are perfect for sharing among a group of friends. Every July, The Cheesecake Factory restaurants nationwide also celebrate National Cheesecake Day with 50% of all cheesecake slices, so the cost of one slice drops down to about $3.50. One of my favorite desserts there (besides the cheesecakes) is the strawberry shortbread. This is a massive dessert with sugary, crunchy shortbread topped with a large quantity of fresh cut strawberries, with generous scoops of vanilla ice cream and swirls of whipped cream on top. At only $8 or $9, the amount of food is really good value. <br&gt;<br&gt;The ambiance at this place is nice.

The quesadilla was on the soggy side and although we ordered the &amp;#34;plain&amp;#34; quesadilla (aka the one without chicken) there was only cheese inside and on the side was some salsa, sour cream and guac (though the guac was quite good and tasted fresh). The BBQ chicken pizza was good since BBQ on pizza is such a great combination....but otherwise the cheese was not very stringy/cheesy, and it was just a plain pizza. Their cheesecake was quite good, we ordered their 30th anniversary cake and it was layers of cheesecake and chocolate cake; although it was very sweet, it was quite satisfying. Their menu is quite extensive so perhaps I can try out their other dishes.....but I kinda don&amp;#39;t have the urge to. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service wise, our server was kind but he never came back to check up on us, and he never bothered to refill our drinks. We tried to wave him down several times but he never looked. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, just an extremely average meal.

The dip itself was pretty good; it was thick and creamy, and reminded me of chowder. The only complaint I had was that there wasn&amp;#39;t much crab in the dip. Maybe it was blended in or something, but I was expecting chunks of crab meat. Not really worth the $11.50.<br&gt;<br&gt;Sherpard&amp;#39;s Pie- This was my first time trying sherpard&amp;#39;s pie, but I thought it was tasty! Has meat, peas, mushrooms, carrots covered in a rich sauce and topped with a mound of mashed potatoes. Meat was flavorful and not dry , and the portion was pretty generous, so would give this dish 5 stars.<br&gt;<br&gt;Grilled Salmon- Fish itself was pretty standard, maybe a little above average. But then again, I&amp;#39;ve never really had a grilled salmon that made me go &amp;#39;MMMMmm, OH SO DELICIOUS!!!!&amp;#39; It&amp;#39;s served with side of tartar sauce and steamed, seasonless broccoli. 3 stars<br&gt;<br&gt;Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake- caramel+pecan layer, followed by cheesecake layer+ chocolate brownie layer.

Let&amp;#39;s be real. I don&amp;#39;t think we go to the Cheesecake Factory for the food. <br&gt;<br&gt;They do have a nice range of options on the menu but I find that nothing tends to stand out very much. I&amp;#39;ve had most of their pastas and usually they&amp;#39;re quite bland. They do have different sauces and taste accordingly, but generally there are no spices or special flavors used to accentuate the natural taste of the vegetables/meats in the dish. The one appetizer I&amp;#39;ve had that really stands out is the Buffalo Blasts. They&amp;#39;re fried balls of Buffalo chicken bits and cheese and they taste heavenly though they&amp;#39;re also extremely greasy... My favorite salad is the Luau salad and not surprisingly, it errs on the unhealthier side of salads. <br&gt;<br&gt;I would definitely recommend sharing main courses and appetizers per table instead of each ordering a main because the serving sizes are very generous. It&amp;#39;s important to make sure to save room for cheesecake at the end! And on that note, I&amp;#39;ll just say that I think the best part about the Cheesecake Factory is the range of choice you get with cheesecakes. I&amp;#39;ve made it a personal goal to never repeat a flavor and to be honest, they&amp;#39;re all amazing in their own way.

Probably not because it was a long dreadful 21/2 hour of painful waiting later.

I did not find anything too special about these items except that they were edible. I also ordered the smoked salmon spring rolls which I would suggest not ordering as they were not very impressive. I found the smoked salmon spring rolls to be bland and I essentially had to drench them in the sweet chill sauce that they came with in order to add some flavour to it. <br&gt;<br&gt;For dessert I had the classic cheesecake with glazed strawberry. This cake is to die for. Absolutely heavenly. The cheesecake itself isn&amp;#39;t dense and heavy, it was surprisingly light in texture and flavour and had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. The pie crust was a tad salty with hints of cinnamon flavour - a very good complement to the sweet cheesecake it holds.

Okay let&amp;#39;s first start off with the fact that they don&amp;#39;t take reservations so depending on what day and time you go be prepared for a wait. Because I&amp;#39;ve been here before on a Saturday and it was packed with an hour wait. But I came here today on a Wednesday night and there was no wait at all. So it&amp;#39;s pretty much luck of the draw. I went with a group of 4 and managed to get a booth seat. As an appetizer I got the buffalo wings. They were good but the skin was kind of chewy. The buffalo wings aren&amp;#39;t that spicy so those with timid taste buds have no fear. My friend asked for the shrimp scampi pasta and they messed up her order so make sure your waiter understands your order. As a quick side note the bathroom here is mad nice. The lighting in there (and the whole restaurant at that) is really dim. Nice for the atmosphere but terrible for pictures (hence why my food pictures suck &amp;amp; I&amp;#39;m not a good photographer). My main dish I got the Cajan Jambalaya Pasta. I&amp;#39;m a person that enjoys extremely spicy food and the description of the Cajan Jambalaya Pasta said that it was in a very spice sauce and it really wasn&amp;#39;t even that spicy. So don&amp;#39;t be fooled. It&amp;#39;s still a great dish though (enjoy the picture of me obnoxiously eating my pasta). For the desert I got the Dulce De Leche Cheesecake. Okay this had to be my favorite part of the meal! I&amp;#39;m not usually a fan of Cheesecake Factory cheesecake surprisingly.

I could have been lying out of my ass (WHICH I WASN&amp;#39;T!) and she still had no right to put her two sense into my personal conversation. After the bathroom, I went to go talk to another manager. While I was gone she continuously walked by my table laughing then asked &amp;#34;where is that white girl at&amp;#34; (mind you she&amp;#39;s a fat white girl, not that her physical appearance matters). When talking to the head managed, Clint I believe was his name, I was told that I was lying and that he knows these employees well and that both the girls saw a bottle of alcohol.

As the group tried to leave they stopped and said we still owed them money and that we didn&amp;#39;t pay. They then argued for awhile saying we should have kept our receipt (they collected it from us). They then discovered that they made ANOTHER mistake and that we did pay and left the extra $20.

This may be the largest Cheesecake Factory I have ever visited and there are certainly enough employees running around to cover all the tables. My friend knew exactly what she wanted from past experiences and our drinks and food came out accurately and at a very good pace. She was very happy when we left...so that alone means it was a good experience and it was also a good place for us to catch up as the noise level overall was very average to low in the restaurant.

Long story short, we were told that there was no balance left on the card and that it was bought at a grocery store rather than at a location. They called the number on the back, and apparently the card was never scanned, pretty much implying that it had been stolen. They couldn&amp;#39;t do anything without a receipt, so I ended up having to foot the bill when I would never even had gone in the first place if it weren&amp;#39;t for the gift card.

Price wasn&amp;#39;t bad for what you get, though.<br&gt;- Beets with Goat Cheese (under their &amp;#39;small plates&amp;#39; menu): description says &amp;#39;fresh beets, apples, baby arugula, and pecans.&amp;#39; It was tasty, but maybe they&amp;#39;re hinting at something by not putting goat cheese in the description...?<br&gt;- Strawberry Creamsicle: tasty like a shake, but again lacking in alcohol for such a large glass.<br&gt;- Bread: definitely better warm, as I&amp;#39;ve had in the past.<br&gt;- Fries: comparable to McDonald&amp;#39;s fries. You can take that however you want to.<br&gt;- Sliders: thin pieces of meat not even formed into patties; obvious they were just scrapped together from a larger patty.<br&gt;- Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake: I swear the size of their cheesecake slices have gotten smaller over the years. So chocolate coconut cream sounded really good to me, but maybe I should&amp;#39;ve assumed there would be coconut flakes even if they weren&amp;#39;t in the description. I love coconut and coconut flavor, but I hate those nasty little flakes.<br&gt;- The Navajo sandwich: we were debating between this and the sliders or just the beef ribs...boy do I wish we had gone with the beef ribs. I&amp;#39;m a sucker for variety though, and having two dishes instead of one somewhat appealed to me more at the time. The dry and tasteless chicken was the worst part, and the sandwich as a whole was really nothing special. <br&gt;<br&gt;All in all, the food sucked. We should&amp;#39;ve just stuck with drinks and maybe another small plate.<br&gt;<br&gt;So we all know how long and inefficient their menu is, but I think the biggest annoyance was not having prices listed under the cocktail section. I had to pick out the ones I wanted so the waiter could ask the bar, and it&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;m going to do the same with each one until I found one with a suitable price... Maybe they should stop taking ads for their menu to make room for listing the prices for everything. Including the cheesecakes, since all they have now is a range of what it might be. I felt like I was flipping through a program booklet rather than a restaurant menu.<br&gt;<br&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br&gt;<br&gt;I just had two leftover sliders that were much tastier broiled with cheddar cheese, toasted bun-tops, and ketchup/fancy mustard, washed down with a glass of wine.

Pretty silly for food that&amp;#39;s just slightly better than the other sodium-packed chains like applebees. Their legendary menu is glossy and has ads in it- which seems unjust given that I&amp;#39;m paying decent money for mediocre food just because of the location and because my little sister was just dying to take me here as I treated her for her birthday. There was a lot to choose from, and the portions were generous. When we mentioned it was her birthday they brought out their namesake dish- which honestly wasn&amp;#39;t that great. I wouldn&amp;#39;t go back here again, but with a cute interior and a huge menu I could see why this is a popular date spot for the college crowd because it feels more upscale than it really is and the price is enough that it feels like a special outing but not enough to bust the bank.
