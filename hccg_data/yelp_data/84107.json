I like their kobe burger and the smoke house BBQ burger but I normally go with their lunch pizza (margarita) and salad. I have tried a lot from their menu by try to save room for a cheesecake. I haven&amp;#39;t had a bad cheesecake yet or one that I wouldn&amp;#39;t order again. Tonight we came in for desert and have their newly updated recipe for carrot cake and I got the Dutch apple caramel streusel. Wow, both were really good. The service has always been great here and Holly tonight was no exception, she did great. And that goes for any Cheesecake Factory that I have ever gone to, the service makes or breaks the dinning experience . The only reason I am give them three stars is for the fact that this has to be one of the smallest and loudest of their restaurants that I have been to.

It reminded me of a &amp;#34;nicer&amp;#34; Applebee&amp;#39;s steak, which is the last place you should be getting steak from. They were cooked alright, but the meat was a bit stringy and tasted lower-quality (perhaps even lower grade) than other steaks in the area. Like mentioned above, neither of us have been overly impressed with any dish other than the pastas. Still, we find ourselves back there after shopping sometimes. <br&gt;<br&gt;The waiters are friendly but usually a bit stiff due to how busy they are (being right next to the mall) we often don&amp;#39;t get refills on drinks until it&amp;#39;s too late, and the limited interactions we have with them feel rushed <br&gt;<br&gt;The desserts aren&amp;#39;t great unless you get cheesecake (go figure, it&amp;#39;s in the name). I would skip dessert unless you&amp;#39;re dying for cheesecake. Even then, there are way too many choices and I would advise sticking to tried and true flavors. I recently tried their chocolate layer cake, and it was dry and boring. <br&gt;<br&gt;Despite other reviews, I love the dark ambience of this restaurant.

The sauce was addicting! I kept dipping my bread in the sauce. I would definitely order this again. The only con- they only give you 6 small dumplings. So, for the price of $10.95....you are paying for quality not quantity. <br&gt;<br&gt;Chicken Madeira: This dish was so disappointing! Ice cold, lacking in flavor, gluey cheese and overcooked asparagus! <br&gt;Disclaimer: We have ordered this dish before at another location and it was wonderful. <br&gt;We complained to our waiter and expressed our concerns about the dish. He acted annoyed and told us he would get a manager and have it remade. The manager brought out the remake and seemed annoyed with us. She did not even apologize for the mistake. If you are going to pay $18+ for chicken, it should at least be hot! The new one had been microwaved for a few minutes (rubbery!). We basically filled up on bread and pot stickers and took our dessert to go. <br&gt;<br&gt;BTW: We paid full price for everything, even though they took 25 minutes to replace a messed up item. <br&gt;<br&gt;Lemon raspberry cheesecake: Out of all of the desserts I have tried at cheesecake factory, this one is by far the sweetest (tastes like pure sugar). I would not get this item again. <br&gt;<br&gt;Craigs crazy carrot cake cheesecake: Very tasty and not too sweet! This carrot cake had a subtle sweetness and was moist! <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall I wouldn&amp;#39;t come back to this location.

We notifyed the waiter about how disgusting our pastas were she said they would make us a fresh batch. 5 minutes later she comes out with the same sloopy looking plates. The only difference was they had obviously heated up our plates. They even kept the same shrimp on the plate just microwaved. Our food was now dryer and the shrimps were hard and a fishy smell.

The city, in addition to badly needing an enema, also needs more upscale chains like this. The interior was nearly spot-on to a lot of the East coast locations I&amp;#39;ve hit up and the only flaw I could find was the black coating peeling back on every one of the benches. Despite it being jammed, this location was also the least amount of time I&amp;#39;ve ever waited to be seated at any of their restaurants. It&amp;#39;s overall borderline artsy and tasteful and apropos for the lofty pretensions this chain has for itself. This is a very good representative restaurant of that, overall. <br&gt;<br&gt;This extends to the food itself. Tons of alcoholic drinks on the menu and their annoying habit of including the Sunday-only stuff in the regular menu, but refusing to make any of it, unless you happen to be there on that day. That menu is extensive, but mostly a hodge-podge of standard Americana stuff, along with a bevy of questionable fusion ideas executed mostly poorly.<br&gt;<br&gt;The hallmark of this chain, to me, is that everything, including the cheesecake, is one note off. This extends to the Coke Zero mix, to the soy ginger, remoulade, Thai peanut and Dynamite mayo sauce, to the &amp;#34;tempura&amp;#34; batter on the shrimp and on down. The warm bread basket was nice and the bread was flavorful. This, along with the perfectly done fries, was probably the best part of the entire thing. The shrimp batter tasted slightly off and refused to go nicely with any of those 4 sauces I mentioned. The Cuban rolls was an intriguing idea; combining a Cubano into a spring roll. In execution, though, it&amp;#39;s basically like they stuck everything in to a blender, stuffed it into a rice wrapper and fried it to death. This also refused to go with sauces, but the idea of a Cubano, when done well, is that it wouldn&amp;#39;t need to. In case it&amp;#39;s not clear, this was not done well.<br&gt;<br&gt;The mango key lime cheesecake was another disaster. Topped with artificial sugar whip, gloppy mango syrup, incredibly overdone key lime flavoring and next to no actual cheesecake taste, then mounted on a crust with bits of coconut that was itself a dense, overly thick chunky mess, it nearly defied eating. In fact, I bailed on it well before the end.<br&gt;<br&gt;This is a place I meant to get to since it opened and while it took longer than expected for the stars to align both with me having opportunity and the lines dying down, I finally made it and now it&amp;#39;s done, probably never to be repeated again.

When she came back to the area and saw it still hadn&amp;#39;t been cleaned up she just threw a napkin on top of the broken glass and liquid, walked away and started giggling with a coworker in the back corner. These shards of glass were on the ground for almost our entire meal. I was actually concerned about a toddler who was running back and forth by all the glass, but no one else seemed to notice or care.<br&gt; They have no problem serving with dirty glassware and silverware.

He waited for our server to come back, he just wanted to replace the biscuit but after about ten minutes he resigned to not having any biscuits. She NEVER came back to check our food, refill our glasses or do her job at all until she decided we needed our check. We showed her the biscuit and she blew it off like, how was I supposed to know? It was completely inedible, like fossilized dinodroppings. She asked if he wanted another, he said he didnt want to risk it and he was done with his chicken, he said he would have taken one earlier but she never came back. I requested for her to bring some biscuits anyway. A few minutes later someone else with crazy person \u00a0makeup came with biscuits and said she heard about the rock biscuit and hoped it didn&amp;#39;t happen again.
