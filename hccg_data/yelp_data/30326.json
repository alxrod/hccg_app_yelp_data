All due to my first amendment right to freedom of speech- and give a complaint!?. He will not publicly accommodate female working professionals.<br&gt;<br&gt;I was traveling alone in town on business- Arriving at the Cheesecake Factory Lenox Mall location approximately 6:30 PM for dinner. After waiting 1 hour for an order, I shared a complaint with manager Ryan Clark. At this point he became aggravated and unreasonable. I became increasingly uncomfortable. At this point I ask for my bill for an appetizer he refused to comp, so I could leave the restaurant. Ryan did not return with bill. After speaking with my server about requested bill she reports being unable to speak with Ryan &amp;#34;about my bill&amp;#34; without retaliation. I approached Ryan in the restaurant and requested my bill once again to leave a hostile and toxic environment and he screamed aloud to patrons and employees, to call the police! For reasons unknown to myself and everyone present this manager attempts to have me falsely charged.<br&gt; I approached the hostess who seated me asking for general management or speak with someone in corporate. Ryan follows and screams at the hostess &amp;#34;don&amp;#39;t talk to her, don&amp;#39;t give her any information, don&amp;#39;t help her.&amp;#34; They refused to provide me with general management name and contact information.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Police arrived as I stood awaiting for a response from someone. Surprisingly, I was approached by Ashley Blewett- Head Chef of Grand Lux Caf\u00e9. She informed me that my server had in fact notified her of Ryan&amp;#39;s offensive actions and she was asked to come speak with me. Ashley insisted Ryan&amp;#39;s actions to call the police was all wrong! and the cops should have never been called. I never even had a Meal! Ashley de-escalated this guy and sought to find a solution for me to leave the restaurant. Finally, Ashley received my appetizer bill from manager Ryan Clark. However, this did not stop officers from harassing me in attempts to arrest and criminally trespass me at Ryan Clarks request. \u00a0Ashley stepped in again to stop officer&amp;#39;s harassment, arrest, and criminal trespass from the Cheesecake Factory. <br&gt;<br&gt;Responding Officer then reprimanded Ashley Blewett for her effort to de-escalate and to deter their collective efforts to further detain, criminally arrest &amp;amp; Trespass (or do who knows what else) \u00a0because Manager Ryan Clark was in Fact the manager on Duty. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;I was not released to leave the restaurant until 8:10 pm with No Meal! <br&gt;Ryan Clark is using his authority to abuse, belittle, intimidate, and humiliate cheesecake factory employees and patrons. He is a liability to the Cheesecake Factory and is unreasonable in his actions. This manager on duty creates and maintains a hostile and toxic environment for patrons and employees. Obviously, I was caught in the crossfire of complete restaurant chaos. Upon return to my hotel I called 911 to report manager Ryan Clark falsely imprisoning me. <br&gt;<br&gt;Atlanta Police department- Zone two precinct- Evening Supervisor- Sergeant Frazier responded to my grievance &amp;amp; complaint. He contacted manager Ryan Clark to request and obtain Cheesecake Factory General Manger (GM) name and contact information. It was discovered general management Melles Amedie was away on vacation for the week. Sergeant Frazier states that manager Ryan Clark is incompetent in customer service and should lose his position at the Cheesecake Factory. He goes on to state &amp;#34;My officers should have never been called into the restaurant to arrest or criminally trespass you.&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;In addition, I spoke with Lieutenant Grigsby and he did some further research on Cheesecake factory corporate office contacts and insist I follow up with complaints to corporate office.", "rating": 1, "date": "10/22/2020"}, {"text": "I am a \u00a0their table brown bread, but please don&amp;#39;t be fooled... this is not whole wheat bread.

I really didn&amp;#39;t want to wait but my baby really wanted it. I went to the restroom and on my way there I spotted SEVERAL unoccupied tables. Well at 9:45 I called the restaurant to see how much longer it was going to take. I was told 5 minutes maximum. As soon as I hung up my phone received the table ready message. <br&gt;Finally we sit at our table unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t remember the waitress name but she was really nice attentive and friendly. <br&gt;I had so much candy at the previous stop and I was so annoyed at the long wait time that I lost my appetite so I went with the buffalo blast an appetizer. Hubby ordered a spaghetti dinner of some sort and the baby ordered the corndogs.<br&gt;My husband dish was excellent (his words) my buffalo blast we not nearly as tasty as I remember and my baby corn dogs looked deformed AF. I did tell my waitress that it was my son birthday. They did not sing to him although somewhere in the far southwest distance I did hear murmurs of staff singing happy birthday to another patron. I have a few ideas in my head as to why my son wasn&amp;#39;t sung to but I won&amp;#39;t go there this time.... but let it happen again !!!!<br&gt;Do better Cheesecake Factory at Lenox DO BETTER or close!!!<br&gt;<br&gt;Look at my baby happy face mommy and daddy sung happy birthday to our baby!!!!!

They also brought food out finally to everyone, and completely left out my 6 year old little girl&amp;#39;s chicken quesadilla. Left all of us sitting there approx 14-16 minutes without her quesadilla. Then the cheesecake order was a hot mess, he brought one piece, 5-7 minutes, 2 more pieces, 12 minutes later the other piece (which was boxed up and taken) There was zero acknowledgement from anyone. All of us were left with empty glasses with no refills. And I still tipped generous just to be the better person. I know most people would tip nothing. <br&gt;<br&gt;These servers are making extremely good money, and have no skill set and are borderline rude. The general manager SUCKS @ Lenox.

Yesterday for the holiday(memorial day) we decided for the first time in months to order curbside,Sense right now I don&amp;#39;t particularly trust sanitary practices of restaurants. I stepped out of my comfort zone and ordered online a turkey burger/ fries from cheesecake factory Lenox mall. When my boyfriend and I picked up the order it was our mistake to not check the food at that time. Since the mall area was crowded and because of COVID-19 we simply rushed to the car and took the order home. It was at home to my surprise my turkey burger was covered with old rotten looking Avocado on it. And to add insult to injury my fries looked like someone had eaten half of them or I was simply cheated out of a full order of fries. The fries literally had no lie 6-7 fries in the box. (See pic) We spent over $25 for the meal and our time to go through the hassle of putting on a mask going to a crowded place picking up curbside to end up with a half order and rotten looking avocado(see pic attached). I called the restaurant requesting a manager and was bounced around to several employees pretending to be a manager. There was a manager in the takeout department with Spanish accent helping me but went into a rant about the fries and some lame excuse about the avocado being brown because it was under a heat lamp. We all know how old avocado looks she then told me to bring all the food back for her to examine it etc. I told her no &amp;amp; please let me speak to somebody else that could help me. She left me on hold for 10 minutes I hung up call back and got another manager Then finally got a resolution that ended in mailing me a gift card for the amount I spent. Sadly this restaurant don&amp;#39;t realize that it wasn&amp;#39;t about the money it was about the quality of their food and the disorganized phone skills of random employees pretending to be a manager while still not helping. no amount of money can make up for the service &amp;amp; gross food we received.

Cheesecake Factory has always been a part of my Atlanta chain restaurant staples. My first experience at a Cheesecake Factory was at the original Buckhead Cheesecake Factory.<br&gt;<br&gt;The wait on a Friday night was pretty long for 2 people. My sister and I got to the restaurant around 9:30PM and waited for about 25 minutes. We were seated in the back of the restaurant, and were constantly being interrupted by people leaving or entering the restaurant through the mall entrance in the back. We rarely saw our server, but were served our basic needs, albeit at a slow pace. My sister ordered a strawberry lemonade and it was SO sickly sweet. She asked for a free refill, but even my sister, Queen of sugary sweet things, couldn&amp;#39;t finish a second glass. She ended up taking a to-go cup. <br&gt;<br&gt;THAT BROWN BREAD THOUGH. I know it&amp;#39;s not pumpernickel, but we trick ourselves into thinking it is so maybe it doesn&amp;#39;t seem as unhealthy. Not that using an entire stick of butter on the bread is any better. It took a while to get to us, but once it did, it was soft and warm. <br&gt;<br&gt;My sister and I split a pasta and an order of calamari. I got tired of the calamari real fast - my sister didn&amp;#39;t like it so I ended up eating the whole $12 appetizer order of fried squid. It was just too much. I prefer not to take fried food to go, so I ended up leaving 1/4 of it there. My sister ordered the tomato basil pasta, and it wasn&amp;#39;t too bad - just a standard pasta. My sister is a picky eater, and didn&amp;#39;t like the pesto drizzle on top - that was NOT listed in the menu.

We have eaten at various other stores and are familiar with their offerings. As usual, have rave reviews for the food and drink. Everything was delicious, well-seasoned and the quality I like to see at restaurants. In addition, our server Brittany was fast, efficient and very pleasant. Cudos all around for her performance.<br&gt;<br&gt;Where this visit went off the rails was at reception. The hostess was nice, but seemed a little frazzled. We were given a 40-minute wait time and instructions on how to respond to the page to my cellphone. Waits at Cheesecake Factory are business as usual, so we took a seat outside. As we waited, I counted 5 empty (dirty) tables waiting to be bussed. The hostess actually cleaned one of the tables when she came to seat guests, but the remaining four were dirty the entire time we watched during our wait.<br&gt;<br&gt;After we were paged and went inside, there was another queue to wait in for a hostess to seat us. Once again, I counted 3 booths and a table (visible from where we were standing) that were dirty and in need of clearing before seating other guests. A number of other guests who had already been paged were lining the walkway and waiting to be seated. (This design created an obstruction to the walkway and a potential hazard.) As we were seated, I noticed that in places the floors were slippery, but this could have been just a spot or two of water spilled on the floors.<br&gt;<br&gt;While we enjoyed our meal, I did notice that a manager was clearing tables, so it&amp;#39;s possible this was an isolated incident, but this is the type of thing that spreads ripples through an entire service. Uncleared tables lead to decreased capacity and longer wait times. These in turn poorly flavor the guest experience and affect return visits.

Definitely not the best dining experience as I had to ask the woman twice to move over, as her hair ended up in my food both times.

I asked her for a refill and she said ok but I saw her walk past several times. The food was so subpar here. The bread they give you was cold and hard.

The lightings of the restaurant are dim and yellow, the concept of the restaurant d\u00e9cor is mixed, it can be romantic but also suitable for groups and gatherings.

I was quite satisfied with my waitress. At times, she was too busy serving other tables, but she came back to check and apologized. <br&gt;<br&gt;Before the meals hit the table, I was served with two different kinds of fresh baked breads, brown honey wheat bread and sourdough. The breads were soft and served hot, goes well with butter. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the Cabonara spaghetti pasta Smoked Bacon, Green Peas, and a Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce and Tortiglioni pasta with meatballs.

Chicken Madeira(~$15): this is their most famous chicken dish which comes as perfectly cooked chicken breasts topped with mozzarella cheese and served with mashed potatoes, asparagus and mushrooms.

My fianc\u00e9 and I decided to go a late night date after been apart for almost two weeks because of work! When we walked in the hostess didn&amp;#39;t acknowledge us for about 10 minutes and when she did her response was &amp;#34; what do you need&amp;#34; after placing our name on the waiting list we took a seat! The wait wasn&amp;#39;t long at all maybe 10 minutes so when we were seated she sat us in the bar area at a table. The waiter &amp;#34;Justin&amp;#34; came to the table and introduced himself and brought a basket of bread. While going through what I took as a normal routine of telling any specials and recommendations I stopped him to tell him that the silverware was filthy with food still stuck in between the fork prongs and as I examined further the saucer for the bread had a black/brown food debris in the middle so I showed him that... He never said anything but he aggressively grabbed the silverware, napkins and plates up with rage! He mad such a ruckus that the table of 4 sitting next to us stopped eating to see what was going on... He then proceeded to walk off with an attitude to the hostess stand where about 6-8 employees was standing along the manager (that stated he was new there and had only been there 2 days ,he looked like he was of Spanish decent, from Knoxville, Tennessee so he didn&amp;#39;t know all of his employees yet) I took it that he went to vent to them about the situation all while still clutching the dirty dishes in his fist. My fianc\u00e9 was appalled so he got and proceeded to the hostess stand to find out what was all that about and exchanged words with Justin who then stormed off to the kitchen area. The &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;manager came over to ask what had happened and we explained the situation but he had no remorse for the situation but only thing he could tell us was that he was new and did we still want to dine in! My fianc\u00e9 didn&amp;#39;t want to eat anymore but I wanted to eat bc it was already late and it would be hard to find another restaurant before closing time. He told us he would get us another waiter which was &amp;#34;Cooper&amp;#34;, he was totally amazing, but the Mgr never apologized but he did ask us what do you want me to do then, of course my fianc\u00e9 said fire him but I was realistic about the situation and was he needed to be reprimanded for that and suspended so he can appreciate his job because we as consumers keep him with a job! If we don&amp;#39;t come in and eat then he has no job. We moved tables because the scene had blown up so everyone in the area was staring to see what would happen next so we moved to feel a little more at ease. I would have thought the manager would have offered some compensation or remorse but of course he didn&amp;#39;t but the waiter Cooper made sure he tried to make the experience pleasurable with his outstanding customer service skills.

Keep in mind they close at 11:00 pm but the service should still be the same as if I had arrived at 2:00 pm especially when your still open to the public. The waitress was a female who seemed ready to get off was always missing in action. I had to keep asking other waitresses can you get her for me. Once the food arrived, the buffalo blast was heavily coated in batter that you could barely taste the meat. Keep in mind I always order the same thing each time I go so I noticed the difference right away. Then when my chicken and biscuits arrived they was luke warm and was not seasoned. My spouse ordered the chicken carbonara which the alfredo sauce was runny like water so we sent it back. Once again we had to ask another waiter to get our waitress and by the time she arrived it is now after 11:00 pm and our original waitress says well the kitchen is now closed. The manager comes over and says let me see if we can get you something else which we ordered a BLT. The BLT comes over and the fries are also luke warm and the manager says he guess they was left over. I never asked for a discount because I pay for what I want so the manager ask me if I wanted a slice of cheesecake and I told him I don&amp;#39;t like sweets. He says well I&amp;#39;m trying to offer you a $ 9 cheesecake for a $ 1 fry.

I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s because we are Asian that you assume we won&amp;#39;t leave good tip so you gave us shitty service from the start, but I would like to say I hope you knew you weren&amp;#39;t getting any good tip from your not even mediocre service. As a person who worked at restaurants I always leave 20% tip, more if the server works hard. But you don&amp;#39;t even deserve 10%. Learn your table manners, look at me when I talk, and look at me when I ask for something, and look and me while you answer instead of looking over at your other black customers that you feel will give you a better tip.

First the waiter did not bring the complimentary bread , we ordered Nachos and we asked for the jalape\u00f1o to be on the side , the dish came burned and soggy with all the sides on another plate , and it seems like it was leftovers and was reheated . We asked to talk with the waiter since he was busy chatting with another waitress , instead he sent the manager to talk to us . He came and was like what do you want ? We told him that the waiter did not bring the bread and he said it was still in the oven !!! Really 20 minutes and may be over in the oven , we told him about the Nachos he seemed like he does not care , he just shoved the plate and told us that another one will be ready soon ,no apology or nothing !! We were so hungry so we waited , otherwise we would of left at this point . Suddenly the waiter appeared he apologized and asked us if we want to continue our meal or not ? \u00a0We told him yes . He brought the bread and the Nachos then came the Fettuccine and the pasta that we ordered , no need to say that the Fettuccine pasta was all broken as if it was the leftovers on the bottom of the pasta box and it was mixed with the other type of pasta that we order , it looks like that they were boiled together !!

They didn&amp;#39;t even try. We were brought bread plates that were dirty and had been eaten off of by other patrons. We had to ask multiple times for silverware. The waiter had such a difficult time getting us silverware that two of us ended up sharing (one roll included a salad fork and a dinner fork). We had to ask three times for him to refill our water. When another couple joined us, the waiter brought bread. They had to ask for bread plates and when they came the top one was clean while the next plate had food on it and the next still had someone&amp;#39;s butter wrapper stuck to it.

Moving along, the food arrived or rather was deposited by a server who could not have been more disinterested if she tried.
