It first started when I tried to place my order online at the cheescake factory website. I was ready to purchase $200+ worth of food for a July 4th celebration lunch for my family. I tried to use my $50 e-gift card to pay a portion of it and the website was not accepting it. It gave me an error message saying it was unable to accept the giftcard and to make sure there was a balance and that the number was entered correctly. I tried to re-enter everything and it gave the same message. I called the phone # on the gift card to make sure the gift card was not used, and sure enough, the $50 balance was confirmed. I tried again on the website, and was again given the same message. I called the customer care # again and this time spoke to a representative. He too confirmed there was a $50 balance available. I asked him to wait on the line while I tried again, and again received the error message. The representative was blaiming the website for being down and to try and speak with customer service. At that point, it felt like he was just trying to pass the buck, so I decided to call in my order. <br&gt;<br&gt;I called the restaurant several times, and there was no answer. I decided then to go to the restaurant to place my order in person to use my giftcard. When I went to the restaurant, there was a line of people that were frustrated because they had placed their online orders earlier that day, was told to come at a specific time to pick up their orders, and their order wasn&amp;#39;t ready at the time they were told. I passed the line and went to the hostess asking to place my order now. She said that it wasn&amp;#39;t possible and that I would need to get in line with all the people waiting for their online orders, in order to even place my order. I explained to her the frustration I just experienced to see if maybe she would take initiative and escalate the matter, or think outside the box and maybe write my order down and enter it in the register, maybe offer a free slice of cheescake for the inconvenience....just something to try and resolve the experience for the customer, but she acted like she could not do anything. She was not even regulating the guests in line making sure they were 6 feet apart from each other, or trying to get status&amp;#39;s on anyones order... she was doing nothing. <br&gt;<br&gt;What a horrendous experience in a place I once considered a top notch restaurant. I was being made to jump through hoops to spend aprox $250 in orders.

There were plenty of spacious spots available, but for some reason we were seated at a booth table sandwiched between two other booths. We figured the more spacious tables were reserved for others, so we decided to just make it work.<br&gt;<br&gt;Ten minutes into sitting down, a waitress comes to us and DEMANDS that we move to another table towards the back because she wants to seat other guests at our table because we are taking up too much space. We were shocked, but we said okay because we didn&amp;#39;t want to bother anyone.<br&gt;<br&gt;This is when it gets BAD. My nephew started crying because the waitress was practically shouting at us due to there being loud music in the restaurant, and he got scared. My sister now was concerned and was trying to calm down her baby.

At my daughter huge plate was only hardly any vegetables, even for the kids menu even comes more...and my pasta wasn&amp;#39;t even ready to eat, half cooked, the pasta partially has sticky together and not even cooked. \u00a0We called to our server and said if they can replace this dish, it&amp;#39;s impossible to eat. The server said ok and call his supervisor. \u00a0The supervisor lady was very nice at the beginning, she \u00a0apologized to us and took the plate by replace for a \u00a0new dish. \u00a0After 7 minutes they bring me a new plate. On this plate looks like less pasta and more creamy liquid dressing..well ok ..I start to eat and it&amp;#39;s was \u00a0better then the first time..and when I tried to take another bite, again was same sticky uncooked pieces of pasta. So they didn&amp;#39;t brought me a different dish...it was same dish, they just tried to remove uncooked pieces but missed of few of them..that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s looked like more less pasta and more like a soup. In this point I lost my appetite..we called to same lady supervisor and showed her same problem..I asked her to take it back and just remove it from my bill. This time she wasn&amp;#39;t nice..make face and said &amp;#34; I&amp;#39;ll see what I can do..&amp;#34; and walk away. \u00a0She never came back to us. Professional ..isn&amp;#39;t? After 10 minutes we saw our previous server that back from her break and asked for the check. \u00a0 <br&gt;She brought us the check and walk away. The did removed the charges of my dish but before they removed it, on the check showed that&amp;#39;s my dish has double charges, like I have been extra charge for the same dish. Unbelievable!!

They always have yummy drinks - alcoholic and non-alcoholic. One of my current favorites is the cucumber lemonade (I ask for a little mint to be added). We can and have made meals just out of their apps - chicken pot stickers, avocado egg rolls etc. They have a good array of small bites where you can try some fun things. Their beet and goat cheese salad is a favorite along with their bang bang chicken and shrimp, thai curry dish. I will say that sometimes the dishes (especially some new ones) can be a hit or miss, however, 9/10 times you&amp;#39;ll leave stuffed and satisfied (portions are HUGE). Of course, the dessert is amazing! They have other things besides cheesecake but with so many cheesecake options alone, you can never go wrong!", "rating": 4, "date": "7/27/2018"}, {"text": "Cheesecake Factory is a great place to go with family or a group because it has a huge menu with a variety of foods and flavors.

Maybe I am just a dessert snob, but something is definitely lacking in the flavor. Sometimes they&amp;#39;re passable, and sometimes they altogether disappoint. From my experience, I deem the downfall to be the cheesecake base itself. I can never taste the cheesecake creaminess of these desserts, even though they are cheesecakes. The consistency is just lacking, unfortunately. Oh well, can&amp;#39;t win them all.<br&gt;<br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I will give praise where it&amp;#39;s deserved though; the Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake is a sweet lover&amp;#39;s dream.

Also, any of the other &amp;#34;specialty desserts&amp;#34; are pretty spot on.

I have ventured out from something as &amp;#34;health oriented&amp;#34; as &amp;#34;The Glam Veggie Burger&amp;#34; to the heartier entrees like, yes, you know it...the pastas! All great, especially the ones drowning in rich, cheeses sauces (to my recollection as it has been years since my last, cheese heavy pasta here).<br&gt;Recently, I tried the &amp;#34;Cajun Jambalaya Pasta&amp;#34; and was blown away. The flavors, the variety of crisp veggies, the sauce itself, will have you wanting to finish the entire plate bite after bite, but you won&amp;#39;t be able to.

Leftovers!<br&gt;<br&gt; \u00a0 Service is great considering how mainstream and packed this place gets on weekends and even some weeknights. So, all in all, I recommend The Cheesecake Factory for a nice meal out with friends whether you&amp;#39;re looking to socialize, get your drink and greasy munch on, or even for something more formal like a birthday dinner or what not.

Service was okay, there was a bit of mayhem at the front hostess station, and they didn&amp;#39;t seem to have a handle on the waiting crowd. We ordered a lot of small plates and the spicy buffalo chicken sandwich. The stuffed mushrooms were okay. There was a beef broth style of sauce at the bottom of the pan, and it was mostly salt-based. The avocado egg rolls were very mediocre. I was hoping for a bit more seasoning or a textural difference inside, but it was pretty much just bland avocado. I did see small bits of red onion, but there was no taste evidence of it. The crunchy chicken samosas were probably the most unexpectedly tasty option out of all the small plates. The grilled cheese strips are not worth it. Save your money and make it at home. Literally, it&amp;#39;s just a grilled cheese sandwich (no fancy cheese or anything) with bacon in it. The spicy buffalo chicken sandwich rocked! The buffalo sauce was a bit sporadic, but the piece of fried chicken was huge and gorgeously crispy. We were getting a bit full when we dove into the sandwich, so we opted to take off the bun, and honestly, it was better with the bun off! The bread added nothing to the sandwich. Overall, if you&amp;#39;re in the area, and the other &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; eatery in the area (used to be one chain of Mexican cuisine, but as of last weekend, a new place was going in), this might be something for you.

I was willing to suffer through my bone dry, (obviously) previously frozen chicken tenders, but when I noticed my boyfriend was also hating his pizza, I asked him if it was as bad as my meal. He said it was pretty bad so I tried a bite. Yeah, it was terrible. <br&gt;<br&gt;So we told the waiter that the food was bad and he INSTANTLY took the food away and called a manager. Oh boy, what a piece of work this lady was. She IMMEDIATELY started trying act like we were some kind of moochers looking for a free meal. She kept saying over and over again (very loudly): &amp;#34;WELL IF IT WAS SO BAD, WHY DID YOU EAT SO MUCH OF IT?&amp;#34; Mind you, we had barely touched the food, and the waiter had already taken it away so that we could not point out the fact that it was barely touched (I bet this was intentional).<br&gt;<br&gt;This manager was looking for an Oscar for her performance or something because holy crap was this woman chewing up the scenery with her over the top acting. It was easily one of the most bizarre things we had ever experienced in a restaurant. She asked us what was wrong with the food, and after every point we made, she exclaimed (practically yelling): &amp;#34;UNBELIEVABLE!!!!

Well, she certainly succeeded in making it into a giant scene. Just about everyone in the place started looking over at our table to see what this lunatic was yelling about.<br&gt;<br&gt;After she went through her whole routine, which I swear she had been practicing in a mirror for these occasions (It seemed so rehearsed), she asked us if we wanted a &amp;#34;to go&amp;#34; bag. A &amp;#34;to go&amp;#34; bag???? For the food we just told you was terrible and we didn&amp;#39;t want? Are you high on crack?<br&gt;<br&gt;I imagine she wanted us to say yes so she could be like: &amp;#34;ah HAH!, SO IT WASN&amp;#39;T BAD AFTER ALL!!!&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;But it really was terrible, and we really didn&amp;#39;t want it.

The last time I went with my husband and daughter, it was for an early dinner/very late lunch, aound 4-ish in a Friday. As you might imagine, it wasn&amp;#39;t exactly busy at this time. <br&gt;<br&gt;They sat us in a weird corner booth by the corner end of the bar where the servers were having their breaks! The first thing we over hear from some servers are, &amp;#34;OMG you&amp;#39;re such a slut.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;So? I flirt with everyone. Men, women, that&amp;#39;s just me. I even kissed that one dude.&amp;#34; And it went on. My daughter&amp;#39;s 3. Call me crazy but we typically don&amp;#39;t like to be surrounded by conversations about &amp;#34;sluts&amp;#34; when we&amp;#39;re out having a family meal with her. <br&gt;<br&gt;Then the servers got back on the floor and we thought, trying to avoid the inconvenienc of having to move, we&amp;#39;d stay because maybe it&amp;#39;ll be OK now. Well, another server came to the designated break table and promptly started complaining about how she did not want to be at work anymore. She&amp;#39;s tired, bullshit at work, she wants to go home, etc. Don&amp;#39;t know about you but I LOVE Debbie Downers! I don&amp;#39;t get enough free complaints and tired, annoyed sighs at work so, of course, soon as I get home I want to go to a restaurant with my family and pay to hear people complain some more!<br&gt;<br&gt;We finally asked to be moved. A very pleasant server took our order. Never saw her again. Another came by our new table and asked if we had been moved and who was our original server. This person was also never seen again. A third person brought out our food, after a much longer wait than we anticipated for such a slow time, and this person really couldn&amp;#39;t be bothered.

I&amp;#39;ll be honest she is picky about her food too. ( I mean i consider myself a good cook, but sometimes she doesn&amp;#39;t eat what I make her, like wtf) so she ended up finishing the whole plate. Yup we were that hungry. <br&gt;<br&gt;Finally we ordered tiramisu. The presentation was remarkable. It looked like a $100 dessert . I was feeling a little fancy after the it arrived on the table. The taste didn&amp;#39;t match the presentation, but overall it was still a good dessert. Frankly I am not a big fan of tiramisu anyways so I wasn&amp;#39;t disappointed with the taste.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall I would love to eat out here again.

Schoolteacher and I had an adventure that landed us somewhat kind of around this area. Remembering that I had been given a gift certificate from my father, I suggested we visit for lunch. We parked in the nearby structure, and walked through the mall over to the place.<br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0After giving the hostess our name, I stuffed the vibrating buzzer thingy into my back pocket, and we discussed our adventures. The place was quite noisy, and the cacophony of the crowds of people waiting for entry into the restaurant, as well as nearby diners made it quite difficult to hear the buzzers alert. However, after some time, I jumped as my left ass-cheek felt the vibrating buzzer informing us that our table was ready. Excited, I returned to the hostess stand, and hostess girl took the buzzer, and said somebody will get you . There we waited for another ten or so minutes. Standing awkwardly in front of the hostess booth before somebody eventually came to get us.<br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 We were led by somebody around the crowded labyrinthian pathways through the throng of tables and eventually seated at a table of our own. I was reminded of those people who work at county fair parking lots, fitting one car right next to another, doing their best to save as much space as possible so they can cram as many cars as they can into a field. We had a couple about a foot our left, and a mother and young daughter about a foot to our right. As we sat down, both couples looked up at us, smiled and politely nodded to us before returning to their personal devices. <br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 Another lengthy wait, and another person came over with menus, introduced himself and took our beverage orders. Person took off and disappeared for some time. Knowing that there would probably be a desert round, I eventually settled upon the Renee&amp;#39;s Special, which had some soup, some salad and some sandwich. Schoolteacher went with the Eggplant Parmesan for the same reason. <br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 Eventually, order guy came back with our drinks, and breads. He then took our orders, and left. Presumably the bread was there to keep us busy while he went off for another break or something. \u00a0It was quite some time before somebody completely different delivered our food. \u00a0Schoolteacher and I chatted about our future plans while we waited for our food.<br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 When the food arrived nearly an hour after ordering, I was quite surprised by the soup. Mainly because order person had neglected to inform what kind of soup came with the special. Turns out it was a baked potato kinda soup. It was quite good though. The salad was also crisp and fresh. The turkey sandwich used a baguette fragment for the bread. With it&amp;#39;s rough and super hard exterior crust, it&amp;#39;s not a bread I&amp;#39;d have personally made a sandwich from. I was reminded of this several times during the meal when a jagged ridge of crust painfully dug into the roof of my mouth. I&amp;#39;ll agree with the other reviewers, the serving sizes are indeed quite large. \u00a0I was full before too long. Schoolteacher was also slowing down on her Eggplant Parm. We decided to get everything wrapped up, and order some cheesecake for later.<br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 I asked a random employee passing by for a to-go box, and one was quickly handed too me. We packed up the remainder of bread, and the eggplant and then waited for order guy to arrive. Who showed up eventually. At that point, I asked him for boxes, some to-go cheesecake, as well as the bill. I had hoped to mitigate the excessive time between visits by getting everything all at once.<br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0Packed up foods and bill arrived after another excessive wait. Thankfully, my total was just ninety cents over the gift certificate. I held onto the bill until the cheesecake arrived. I then packed up my to-go items, and left him a nominal tip. Probably more than I should have, but sometimes I&amp;#39;m far too nice for my own good.<br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 We got our parking stub validated, and returned to the structure to leave. \u00a0Later on that evening, after our bellies had cleared room, the cheesecake was in fact, quite delicious. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt; So overall, the food was simply ok. The cheesecake (and I from what I&amp;#39;ve heard the drinks) is quite wonderful. The service however was as slow as molasses in January. \u00a0I didn&amp;#39;t know who to complain about because I had fifty different people during the course of the nearly two hour meal. The place is crazy crowded, and as a result, it is super noisy.

I mean if you&amp;#39;re someone who constantly eats out like me, you learn to just accept that some places will have waiting period no matter what. <br&gt;<br&gt;The thing is, you wait on average 20+ minutes, and the food isn&amp;#39;t that great.

I&amp;#39;ve had great meals / experiences, but this was not one of them.<br&gt;<br&gt;Two problems, and how management handled them are at issue here.<br&gt;<br&gt;First, my family I were taken by the host to be seated, only to find that the table was not ready. No biggie, except the restaurant was very crowded and we were asked to wait at an awkward drink station in the middle of the room, with servers rushing all around us while we waited.<br&gt;<br&gt;Well, after about four or five minutes, they finally get the table cleared. As we&amp;#39;re being led back by the host to the table, the manager steps in and seats another couple. Our host tried to explain that we&amp;#39;d been on our way to being seated for the past six or seven minutes, but this manager refused to here it. Instead, he yelled at a bus boy to quickly clear another table for us.<br&gt;<br&gt;Now the manager didn&amp;#39;t acknowledge us. He could have apologized of the inconvenience, but he didn&amp;#39;t. We were led to another spot to stand, this time by the bathrooms.<br&gt;<br&gt;Here&amp;#39;s were the first problem intersects the second. As we&amp;#39;re waiting outside the bathrooms, in an awkward placement that basically puts us in front of another family table, we begin to smell something AWFUL. My wife looks down, and sees that the floor is covered in feces. And the trail of sh*t leads back to the men&amp;#39;s bathroom.<br&gt;<br&gt;So someone lets the servers know, and they get a guy to come and start cleaning the floors. Of course, we&amp;#39;re checking our shoes, trying to dodge around the &amp;#34;brown footprints&amp;#34;, when another server shows up and seats ANOTHER couple at the table we&amp;#39;ve been waiting for - AGAIN!<br&gt;<br&gt;At this point, we&amp;#39;ve had our table delayed or given away three times, we&amp;#39;ve been standing in the restaurant over 12 minutes, and there&amp;#39;s sh*t all over our shoes.<br&gt;<br&gt;Luckily, our host this time demands we be seated, and we are - right next to the bathrooms.<br&gt;<br&gt;Somebody arrived and sprayed air freshener on the floor, so the odor went from poop, to vanilla and poop.<br&gt;<br&gt;Look, I&amp;#39;m understanding, and didn&amp;#39;t raise a ruckus though I could have. We ate our meal and left, but I am disappointed in the manner the management treated us. They should have taken us back to the waiting area instead of standing us in various spots. He (the manager who took our first table away) should have apologized instead of ignoring us. They (the staff) should have done a better job cleaning the floors and offering guests near the smell (it wasn&amp;#39;t just us who were suffering) accommodations or the chance to sit somewhere else.<br&gt;<br&gt;If any supervisors from the Cheesecake Factory read this, please train your managers and employees to handle these situations better.

HEY HEARS A THOUGHT: instead of making the size absolutely ridiculously big with filler lettuce - make it NORMAL with a few more pieces of chicken. and while we are at it - take 2 bucks of the price to make it actually appropriate. because the price tag is inflated right along with the cheap iceburg lettuce. <br&gt;<br&gt;oh but great play indeed finding the most effective way to profit off your menu items - in true chain restaurant form. im guessing this cost *maybe* $2 in ingredients since its made up of iceburg (the cheapest lettuce with zero nutrients) and tortilla strips.<br&gt;<br&gt;come for the cheesecake, stay for the cheesecake. nothing else.", "rating": 2, "date": "2/8/2012"}, {"text": "Been to Cheesecake Factory a few times and this past time was the best so far.

We were a group of 8 and got to cheesecake factory around 8pm. We waited for a table about an hour and got seated outside. It was a cold day but the heaters kept us comfortable. The lighting is terrible outside and we couldn&amp;#39;t see out menus at all. We had to use our phones to see. Our server Danny was nice and friendly and greeted us right away. He told us there was no more wheat bread which was terrible news as I love that bread more than life. We all ordered drinks, appetizers and entrees pretty close to each other as it was late and we were hungry but Danny said he would put the appetizers in first so we would get it before our meals. I went to the restroom while waiting to eat. It was easy to find and not far but the water was way too hot! My hands turned red from it. I complained about it and was told that the water was approved by some company or something and that it couldn&amp;#39;t be altered to a cooler temperature. I walked back to my table and noticed all the other tables had wheat bread and I was angry that we were told it was all gone. I found some ready to be served and grabbed it and took it to my table. When Danny later asked me about the bread asking where I got it I told him &amp;#34;I found it.&amp;#34; He laughed it off but didn&amp;#39;t offer me any explanation. Our food arrived shortly after and I complained that we hadn&amp;#39;t gotten our appetizers yet and told Danny to just forget bringing it as we were already served our meals. He told us he was sorry and offered them on the house. We all ate quickly as they were closing around 11 and we were the last ones there. <br&gt;Overall Danny was kind and friendly and apologetic and I don&amp;#39;t blame him at all.

But that was remedied pretty quickly. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our orders came out perfectly, drinks were refilled, we were checked on and just enough times to make sure we were happy, and we were.

We had not mentioned anything at all because it had been a rather solemn day for my son.

I&amp;#39;m a store manager at a retail store and understand how busy and crazy it can get in a customer service oriented environment. However, this restaurant and the communication between staff as well as communication from Customer to Employee is something I haven&amp;#39;t seen in awhile. I gave my name at 7:05pm and was told it would be a 20-25 minute wait. I specifically wanted the patio area facing Ventura; we live in the area and usually grab to go. After waiting 35 minutes I went to check in. I gave it an extra 10 minutes bc I did see they were very busy. I came in and the hostess stated it would be another 10 minutes. We waited another 20 minutes and were called only to be taken to an inside seat. At this point, I had seen three couples who came in after us seated in the patio area. I explained the situation to one of the runners who was going to seat us at the table. She went to check with her supervisor, who based on her facial expression didn&amp;#39;t really care. The hostess came back and said &amp;#34;it would be another 10 minutes.&amp;#34; We barely come in and eat here and now I know I never will. I compare it to my own retail store. For example, what if I rang up a customer all the way in the back and skipped a certain individual just because of poor communication or just plain bias. That&amp;#39;s what it felt like and honestly that&amp;#39;s what it was. As a professional in customer service for 10 years this particular establishment is not organized nor is it run smoothly.

I know because I used to go to school at Paul Mitchell next door and I would frequent this location and never had a great experience. I came to this location twice in 3 weeks. Most recently I went for lunch yesterday with two friends of mine. The wait was only 10-15 minutes which isn&amp;#39;t bad for Cheesecake. I always order the same item: Four Cheese Pasta with a substitution of Rigatoni. It&amp;#39;s my favorite dish. Sometimes we order a few appetizers or small dishes. This location HAS THE WORST FOOD of any Cheesecake location I&amp;#39;ve been to. It&amp;#39;s just never on point or tastes right. My poor friend ordered a cheese pizza and it tasted like dish soap and smelled absolutely disgusting. It&amp;#39;s like they cooked her pizza on a half dirty and half soapy tray. The young male server with curly hair was polite, but he should re-think serving as a career choice. First he forgot my lemonade that I ordered until half way through the meal. Our waters were always low. He never remembered to bring us bread a second time. After I was finished eating, with no water and no lemonade, he finally asked if I wanted a refill. It was too late, I already was dying of thirst the whole meal! He was never within ear shot to call over to tell. My pasta was rubbery and the sauce was bland. My other friend had a salad and hers seemed good. Then, my friend (after only eating a bite of her pizza) told the waiter about the taste of her food and he just said sorry and didn&amp;#39;t even offer her a menu or to substitute it for something else. It&amp;#39;s never a memorable dining experience and the food is always below average here.

THAT&amp;#39;S how bad this place is.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Cheesecake Factory boasts a menu that is large. No, not large. Gigantic. I dont really know how I felt about a place that serves Orange Chicken, Steak Diane, Wasabi Mashed Potatoes, and Chicken Parmeasean under the same roof, but I was willing to give it a try. \u00a0When a menu for an establishment is that large, it means it&amp;#39;s either featuring a collection of unique items from speciality chefs around the world OR really, really, really bad food with nothing good enough to be a &amp;#39;featured&amp;#39; item. Unfortunately, Cheesecake factory falls into the latter.<br&gt;<br&gt;When I can&amp;#39;t decide what I want to eat at a restaurant I&amp;#39;ve never frequented before, I usually go straight for the &amp;#34;What are they famous for&amp;#34; factor...however I couldn&amp;#39;t eat Cheesecake for dinner. Or could I? No. Not in public.<br&gt;<br&gt;According to the menu, their most popular dinner speciality happens to be a combination of Chicken Madiera (their most popular chicken dish), Steak Diane, and Mashed Potatoes. I ordered the steak medium-rare to \u00a0be on the safe side but was a little worried when my waitress dropped off a steak knife to our table before my entree arrived. \u00a0Last time I checked, Steak Diane was small enough medallions to where you didn&amp;#39;t have to cut them with a knife.<br&gt;<br&gt;My Dinner arrived in a timely fashion, however my level of excitement quickly dwindled once I stared down at the disarranged slop of SHIT-ake (looking) mushrooms covering my main course. My steak was on the left, chicken on the right, and the potatoes in the middle. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Steak:<br&gt;According to the menu the Steak Diane is &amp;#34;a mix of sirloin medallions, onions, and mushrooms in a mushroom sauce.&amp;#34; There were NO onions in this mess and literally 50-something mushrooms. The sauce was extremely sweet and didn&amp;#39;t match what I have grown up to know what Steak Diane was. I was calling the search for my meat The Great Steak Escape, but once I found my little medallions I understood why I was given a steak-knife. This steak (which was supposed to be medium rare) was cooked WELL DONE with a super gritty and fatty texture that was unappetizing and flat out disgusting. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Chicken:<br&gt;According to the menu, the Chicken Madiera is a piece of a chicken breast covered in asparagus, mozerrella cheese, and a &amp;#34;madeira&amp;#34; sauce. First off, I can see where the word MADiera came from, because this meal pissed me off. \u00a0The chicken was flattened to the size of a piece of notebook paper, covered in globs of burnt cheese, and (just like my steak) covered in about 50-something mushrooms. The sauce was exactly the same as the steak diane sauce (imagine that!). <br&gt;<br&gt;The mashed potatoes were made from red potatoes (which I don&amp;#39;t care for) but weren&amp;#39;t bad. The asparagus was quite good, actually. I don&amp;#39;t cause problems at restaurants and never return food because that animal was still killed for a reason, not to be thrown in the garbage.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Cheesecake Factory is a place for middle-class families that want a big selection of things that they might enjoy yet have a backup plan dinner in case they don&amp;#39;t.

The guest of honor asked me a few times where we were going and I had to keep telling them that it was a secret because if they knew we were going to Cheesecake Factory they would know something was up because they know me and they know I wouldn&amp;#39;t pick this restaurant for the dining pleasures of the two of us. <br&gt;<br&gt;The surprise went well, but that was really all that went well. The 20 minute wait turned into nearly an hour. Once the pager went off even the hostess tried to make a joke about the wait to lighten the mood and apologized. Appreciate the effort.<br&gt;<br&gt;We were seated and spent almost exactly enough time to get situated and open our menu before the manager came over and asked the entire party of 6 to move from a table to a smaller booth. Really? We waited an hour for your hostess to put us at the &amp;#39;wrong&amp;#39; table? Thanks.<br&gt;<br&gt;Now this next blip on the radar was out of the control of the restaurant because the fire alarm went off. No biggie, maybe a kid pulled it, maybe there&amp;#39;s a fire, maybe it&amp;#39;s a test. Maybe our server could have come by the table and told us what was going on, like if we needed to leave, or be worried, of if the restaurant turned into a strobe filled disco at 8:00. Nope, after enough time to get a headache from the noise and lights and ask each other questions like one of us was in on a prank we were able to flag down a server since ours was no where to be seen, maybe she evacuated, what was going on. At this point I was ready to leave and hadn&amp;#39;t been for the group we would have.<br&gt;<br&gt;So service gets a big fat ZERO.<br&gt;<br&gt;Food, well the wheat bread was good, but that&amp;#39;s easy to do. I&amp;#39;ve had a few things at a few different CCF locations and I can never remember what I had the last time because I don&amp;#39;t frequent the place often. I decided that Garlic Noodles sounded good. I was spoiled by the Garlic Noodles at Crustacean which are heaven, which I don&amp;#39;t believe in, in a friggin bowl. The flavorless noodles at Cheesecake Factory are why I now believe in a hell.<br&gt;<br&gt;My friend asked me the simple question, &amp;#34;Did Crustacean ruin garlic noodles for you and are you being a food snob and not giving CheeseCake a fair chance because Crustacean has the best Garlic Noodles ever?&amp;#34; My response was simple and honest. &amp;#34;No! Crustacean did not ruin all other garlic noodles, CheeseCake Factory ruined theirs all by themselves.&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;I go to the ArcLight all the time and we pass CheeseCake Factory and in a pinch would have eaten there before a movie. That&amp;#39;s no longer an option. <br&gt;<br&gt;The only thing, ONLY thing I will enter this place for is a slice of cheesecake TOGO. So there&amp;#39;s the positive in the review, I will eat their cheesecake and take it to go.

We finally sat down and when our waiter found out that two people in our party worked at a different CF he proceeded to ignore us the rest of the night (assuming that our friends would take over his duties).<br&gt;<br&gt;When he was asked if we could get the employee discount he said he would check with his manager and let us know, but he said that it should be fine. He took our order and disappeared. Everyone&amp;#39;s food came out at different times including a pizza that didn&amp;#39;t arrive for almost 20 minutes past everyone else&amp;#39;s food (which was now getting cold).<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the hummus and it was horrible. Bits of raw garlic in there that gave it a pungent taste.<br&gt;<br&gt;The waiter arrived at the very end to hand us our check and then informed us that we wouldn&amp;#39;t be getting the discount. We figured out our bill, gave him our cards, and then waited 30 more minutes to get them back.<br&gt;<br&gt;We signed (had to pay automatic gratuity even though the service was horrible) and got the hell out of there.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you really love Cheesecake Factory food, then I suggest getting it to go and skip the hassle of crappy service.<br&gt;<br&gt;Oh, and both of my roommates got food poisoning that night.

I have cravings for the sweet brown bread flecked with oat which I can only satisfy there. Today I was especially ravenous and inhaled 3 warm buttered slices. Mmmm so good.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had quite a number of items from its extensive menu over my lifetime, and today I was yet again surprised by the new &amp;#34;special menu.&amp;#34; I thought I was going to order an oldy but goody, Cajun Jambalaya or the BBQ Chicken Salad, but the Chicken Bellagio pasta ($12.95) tempted me. Thin breaded chicken (so that it had a nice crisp when you bite it) sat atop basil pesto (redundant I know) spaghetti noodles. On top of the 2 large thin chicken patties was a sizable sheet of prosciutto with arugula leaves raining upon them all. Honestly, it was very good. It&amp;#39;s not a difficult dish to make by any means, but it was hearty and filling, and the slight bitters complemented the salted meat and the tender chicken. I love the textures you get to experience. Mmmm. And of course, I had leftovers to enjoy the next day.<br&gt;<br&gt;Since I felt like treating myself, I caved to a slice of cheesecake too. I was torn between the carrot cake (which I&amp;#39;ve had and is very good) and a cheesecake of sorts (e.g. tiramisu, key lime). I came across a Carrot Cake Cheesecake... and I thought, it&amp;#39;s perfectly meant for me! So I gave it a shot. It definitely is carrotcake swirled with cheesecake, cream cheese icing and patted down with almond slice. It was decadent. I liked it but I do think I will have to stick to one or the other going forward. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now I am home and replete with food, and content knowing I have more of both entree and dessert just waiting for me in the fridge.

Our server whose name was Nora and who&amp;#39;s the reason why I&amp;#39;m writing this review, was extremely rude and needs another class on how to deal with customers. She didn&amp;#39;t greet us, or even make eye contact. She seemed irritated. She asked what we wanted to drink and then our food order. She gave us bread that was sitting on ANOTHER TABLE, so it goes without say that the bread was cold and stale. We ordered soup as our appetizer and she brought that in about 10 minutes. As we&amp;#39;re waiting for our food, the outside patio begins to get full and we see people ordering their meals and receiving them shortly after. 40 minutes pass and we call her over and ask her to check on our food. We didn&amp;#39;t even know if she acknowledged our question or not because she just walked away. I then noticed her walking to the register and imputing something in the computer. (perhaps our order that she forgot to put in 45 minutes ago?) She comes back 5 minutes later and says the food should be coming out shortly. My father asks her for paper napkins and she looks at him and says, &amp;#34;Anything I could bring you while you&amp;#39;re waiting?&amp;#34;, my father repeats again, &amp;#34;Paper napkins please&amp;#34; and she turns her head away and rolls her eyes. Another glorious 15 minutes pass and we see her walking to our table with my mothers and fathers food. She tells me that she&amp;#39;s going to go bring mine now. My father ordered his usual plate which was a jambalaya pasta, but it looked more so like a jambalaya soup. He specifically asked for no onions but behold! There were onions.

(What was the point of a family dinner again?). The manager or whoever it was who brought out my food, said my steak Diane was over cooked and that they had to remake it. He said he would take it off the check, which he did. Very long story short, I work in the retail industry which is quite similar to the food industry and we all have our bad days but we never throw it out on our customers. What was supposed to be an enjoyable family dinner, turned into nothing but frustration and anger, and not the best dishes. All I ask, is for better customer service.

The food is and pretty much always has been just so so it just works for groUPS when you have people with different price points, and when you just want a basic meal.

It smelled awful, I tasted it and it tasted like dirt and grit, like something that should have been cleaned, WASN&amp;#39;T!! I send it back, they bring another, I didn&amp;#39;t taste it this time because it smelled better. Get it home and much later heat it, sit down and with just the light from the TV I can see that the shrimp were filthy front and back, and by filthy I mean Completely FULL of shit!!! \u00a0For any eating place this is astronomically \u00a0unacceptable. \u00a0This isn&amp;#39;t, oh I didn&amp;#39;t like how it tastes.

We asked to be sat at that table. After about 15-20 mins a cute little Mediterranean girl came to our table to take our drink orders I asked the waitress if they carried Ciroc vodka and she didn&amp;#39;t know, my friend asked if they had cotton candy martinis, she didn&amp;#39;t know that either, but she did offer to go check with the bartender, we gave her alternative drinks if they didn&amp;#39;t carry what we preferred I ordered belvedere and pineapple juice and my friend had a patron ultimate margarita. 15-20 mins later she returned empty handed to get the same drinks ordered in the alternative stage of the first visit. I asked for some crab bites as well as some crab wontons. The cute little waitress disappeared for what seems like hours to return again empty handed (no drinks, no bread) to take our food orders. I asked for some bread and water please. She said okay sure, ill get that for you and then again she disappeared for like another 30 mins before she brighten my day again with her smile and my drinks (SARCASM SARCASM) so around the fourth round the food comes, we ask for more hot fresh bread and cuteness (waitress) (SARCASM) smiles and says I will get that right out to you guys... well again she disappears for about 20 mins before returning and saying that the bread will take an additional 7 minutes because it was in the oven.. OK we said and continued to have a good time... Ok this is where it all goes downhill... We ask her to wrap this food up so we can get out and enjoy this sunny Friday afternoon. She wraps up everything and returns with the check... The check is roughly about $100.00 (CRUMBS compared to what my Boo-Thang and I spend on Sundays) we look over the check, drop off $120.00 cash, pick up our belongings and proceed to take the 15 min hike from the restaurant to the car... laughing and being merry the whole way. We are literally seconds from the elevator (in fact just past starbucks) when we hear some African American girl screaming excuse me, excuse me, we never stop to see whom she screaming for because it has nothing to do with us... but this NOISE is getting LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER, CLOSER CLOSER CLOSER ... BOOOOOM (this chick was coming for us) she runs right up to us and says (verbatim) \u00a0EXCUSE ME LADIES (SARCASTICALLY) YOUR CHECK WAS $91.94 (EXACTLY) AND YOU ONLY LEFT... she open the bill fold and counts out right in my FREAKING FACE RIGHT HERE IN THE FREAKING COURTYARD $120.00 CASH. Then this sweet little African American girl (SARCASM) finds her indoor voice and says I apologize we didn&amp;#39;t count the money right, thank you and disappears back to the CCF. Standing there holding my mouth in my hand because I am SOOOOOOOOOOO Appalled at what just happened, my homegirl and I looked at each other and said... we should have asked her for our freaking $28.00 tip back... I told my homegirl I am calling the restaurant to complain as sooon as we get to my house. Get home get settled, called the restaurant and spoke with the manager I forgot her name seeing as she was so helpful, sweet and attentative (SARCASM SARCASM SARCASM) I won&amp;#39;t even go into detail about that phone call because it was even more appalling that the girl accosting us in the courtyard.... Ill wrap this up seeing as I have already dragged this story out and imp beating this horse dead for life... I ended up calling there corporate headquarters and speaking with a lady by the name of Colleen.... Oh what a TRUE GEM... (I really mean that) She was everything that I needed to feel better about the experience (FOR REALS)not only was she just as appalled as I was about the experience. She was sweet, apologetic, attentive, ready to please... she listened to me with great concern, she was not dismissive like the restaurant manager. She assured me that she would for sure make up for the bad experience and too looks for something sweet in my mail box... So I am looking forward to that! \u00a0I said all this to say... I work in the medical field and I always try to execute the same customer service I would want back, so shockingly I was at my own job on Tuesday 02/21/2012 when I had a new patient, the patient filled out his paper work and proceeded in to see the doctor, after he was seen by the doctor the chart comes to me for billing and coding.. I reviewed the information in the chart; the patient was a staff member at the CCF in Sherman Oak.
