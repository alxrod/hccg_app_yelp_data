I eat at any CF I come across whether I&amp;#39;m in my home state of NJ or Traveling through the country.

I stay at a nice hotel with a nice restaurant but I prefer CF over anything the restaurant here has. That being said; I was super disappointed last night. I&amp;#39;d say the blame is 70/30 between the CF and the DD driver (CF taking the 70). I ordered the Thai lettuce wraps(a staple for me) the new spicy cauliflower bites and key lime cheesecake. When it arrived and I took everything out of the bag something was leaking. Turns out it was two of the three sauces and they were all over everything. So I wiped everything down and realized there was no plastic ware. Remember I&amp;#39;m in a hotel so I could either let my food get colder (it was 33 degrees last night so I was expecting that) or I could just eat the lettuce wraps with my hands. Surprise number 3...no chicken. I know they usually package it separately but apparently they forgot to place it in my bag (or the driver had a snack on the way here) So now I&amp;#39;m eating vegetarian lettuce wraps with my hands. The cauliflower bites were EXCEPTIONAL! I could eat them all day every day lol. A fork would have been helpful because they are quite sticky. I waited about a half hour after eating to break into the cheesecake. Key lime...delish but hard to eat (I had to use two plastic coffee stirrers ) and the top of the cheesecake was smashed like it was tipped over. That&amp;#39;s on the DD driver. Likely that&amp;#39;s the cause for the leaking containers as well.:.but the lack of chicken and plastic ware is on CF. And yes, the driver should have checked for a fork but when your packing something to go, especially with a hotel address....throw a fork in the bag. <br&gt;This won&amp;#39;t keep me from ordering CF again tonight lol. I&amp;#39;m here till Wednesday and there&amp;#39;s nothing I&amp;#39;d rather eat up here than CF....I received a small credit for the chicken/fork blunder last night so they better make it up to me by making sure everything is in the bag and tightly wrapped.

I ordered on the phone for pick up, a margarita pizza, chix Alfredo, chopped salad and two cheesecakes. Said 25 mins, okay sounds reasonable. <br&gt;<br&gt;I Come in after 25 mins to pick it up, they already charged me for it, so I thought maybe the food was ready. Waited for quite sometime only to find out that my food was just waiting in the kitchen to be picked up. First of all, don&amp;#39;t charge a customer whose order is not even ready to begin with and has to wait for 20 mins to get it. Now, I get my food finally and I check it out and the Pasta they used was penne instead of linguini. I didn&amp;#39;t ask for it, and it looked like slop. Manager was there and I asked him if it normally comes like this, he then apologizes and I changed it to angel hair. Waited again for another 30 mins, all for a corrected Alfredo. It has been an hour that I&amp;#39;ve been waiting. They couldn&amp;#39;t even communicate to rush it. Finally the guy in the counter saw me and tried to rush my order from the back. I finally got it and didn&amp;#39;t even bother to check it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now comes the tasting part. The pizza, as you expect, was already cold. It was a bit undercooked too. I can still taste some raw pizza dough. Sauce was good tho. The salad was okay, had balsamic vina. The only bad part was the chicken, it was one of the leftover ones you get from the slicer. The end pieces of the chicken. They didn&amp;#39;t bother to chop that. The two cheesecakes were good, as expected. But the damn Alfredo, was a disaster. The sauce was not even seasoned, along with the chicken they use. It was like eating reduced heavy cream with just a touch of parm. Horrible, so horrible.

After sitting down we ordered a round of drinks. One of the girls in our party asked to have the house espresso martini with baileys (theirs is only coffee and vodka) the waiter explained that he would have to charge her for a shot of baileys and the full martini price (which would have been a $22 martini, and obviously not the right way to ring it up) and we said fine, just because she really wanted it. Drinks come out and the girls martini was more coffee/no baileys and was unhappy with it, because we specifically asked to have baileys in it, not more coffee. We send it back and in return she looked to receive what she wanted. After tasting it we realized it was straight baileys. She didn&amp;#39;t want to complain and just drank it. When the waiter came around I politely asked what was the martini. He said baileys chilled. So after explaining the up-charge to us he brings a martini with extra coffee, then just straight Baileys and blames it on the bartenders. Everyone orders a second round except the one girl because her experience was already ruined. She orders a water. About 15 minutes go by and we only receive one drink and no food. The one drink that comes out is a baileys straight up in a martini glass. Haha has to be some kind of sick joke. We get the waiter and politely explain no food or drinks, except this baileys martini that no one ever wanted. He now blames the kitchen on the food. A minute later our over cooked food from being under a heat lamp shows up, except our chips and guacamole. Still no drinks. I stop the waiter and he can see that things aren&amp;#39;t going good, so he immediately offers a manager. Manager comes over in a very condescending tone, blaming that they cut a bartender and having issues in the kitchen, and giving credit to the lackluster server. Meanwhile still no drinks. Manager explains he will go to the kitchen to see what&amp;#39;s going on and will come back with our drinks (and we now see our drinks sitting on the bar). Manage comes back 5 minutes later and While our manager is talking our drinks now show up, except the poor girls water, and missing another persons drink. Manager asks is there anything else he can do. And we said yes, can we get her a water. Water never comes out. (Manager can&amp;#39;t even handle a water order?!) Waiter is now hiding from us. I had to get the waiters attention for the water, and the other girls drink. After finishing the second round our drinks sat empty for 15 minutes. Now our meal is forced to be over because we can&amp;#39;t even receive service. We receive our check and there is two baileys rocks$ martini charges, which is basically 4 shots, even though the request was for one shot! At first it seemed to be a simple mistake but progressed into a disaster. Nothing was done to ensure a better evening.

After having an extremely poor experience at this Cheesecake Factory, I reflected on what had actually happened before writing this review as to not overreact.<br&gt;<br&gt;One evening about 2 months ago my boyfriend and I decided to venture to CF, I was having a craving for cheesecake, and the food is also pretty decent. So we were off to get dinner. When we arrived the the hostess took our name down and told us that it would be a short wait, which was fine. When we were seated it didn&amp;#39;t take very long before we knew what we wanted to order because we always get the same thing.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our server came over and was polite. We placed our order with him when he arrived, for me the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic, and for my boyfriend, a cuban sandwich. We also ordered an appetizer, fried calamari. Now for the appetizer we had a specific request, neither myself or my boyfriend like the tentacles that are normally served with fried calamari so we asked if we could have the rings only. Now this is something that we have asked for on more than one occasion and at more than one CF. The server said that there was no problem and left the table to go put in our order. A few minutes later he came back to the table and told us that he was sorry but that his manager said that it was against policy to serve the fried calamari without the tentacles. I explained to the server that we ask for this every time we come in and it has never been a problem, we asked to speak with the manager...<br&gt;<br&gt;A man came over, unfortunately I do not know his name, but he was very nice and told us that he would oblige our request for us. He did explain that it&amp;#39;s not normally something that they do but that he would do it for us. A few moments later our fried calamari came to the table with the tentacles, so it seemed like there was some miscommunication. We explained to the food runner that the manager said he would make our order rings only, this she was not aware of, so she took the plate back to the kitchen. A few minutes after that a woman came charging over to our table and said, &amp;#34;just so you guys know we can never do this for you again!!&amp;#34; I replied by telling her that we already spoke to a manager and everything was taken care of. She condescendingly replied, &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m the manager and I don&amp;#39;t know who told you that we do this but we don&amp;#39;t, It&amp;#39;s against our corporate policy!!&amp;#34; I told her that this is a regular occurrence and that we have never had such a problem before. She argued with me that she doesn&amp;#39;t do this for anyone and that our request would never have been granted at HER CF and that if corporate found out that she did this she would be in a lot of trouble. At this point there was no arguing with her. Every thing we attempted to say was shot down by her. She was so unprofessional. She had no interest in giving us a good guest experience from the start. She was right and that was it!!! We asked her for her business card with every intention of complaining to corporate and as she went to give us the card she just tossed it at us like she was doing us a favor, and then stomped away from the table like the beast that she was.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you are planning on visiting this CF remember a few key things. 1. this place is run by a female dog named, Stephanie Bucciarelli, on a power trip who obviously has no training on how to give customer service. 2. Be prepared for a mediocre experience with an upscale price tag. and 3. get your order of cheesecake to go as to spare yourself from the rudeness that is oozing out of this place. 4. If you have a complaint, voice it, because without feedback issues cannot be known or corrected.<br&gt;<br&gt;Needless to say that my boyfriend and I have not visited CF since.<br&gt;<br&gt;P.S. Many other chains like Houlihan&amp;#39;s, Long Horn, Olive Garden, even Maggiano&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t even serve the tentacles or will hold the tentacles with no argument. I don&amp;#39;t understand why this caused such a big problem, never has this ever been an issue at any other restaurant establishment no matter what the cost.

The menu is big offering all different types of food and I&amp;#39;ve never gotten a meal I didn&amp;#39;t love. I&amp;#39;ve been here twice since they moved to the other side of the mall, most recently yesterday, 1/1/2018, with my sister after a little New Year shopping. One thing that baffles me is why, when rebuilding, they didn&amp;#39;t open the foyer area up more. You come in and are given a pager and told your wait time and then after it goes off you wait some more on the other side of the hostess stand. I don&amp;#39;t mind waiting &amp;amp; always come prepared to wait because I understand the high demand of this place however waiting on top of strangers in heavy coats is frustrating since they just redid this place and had the chance to fix it. Moving on - we were seated, given menus and soon realized it was going to take our waitress awhile to get to us as another table next to us was flagging down other servers trying to find her. I&amp;#39;m assuming she had another section to wait on since I rarely saw her in the area, which is fine but if you&amp;#39;re going to give a server two sections try to make them somewhat near each other that way she can easily check on both. Eventually she came over and took our drink order, which, thank God because between shopping and the wait, I was thiiiiirsty. I got the Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta from the Skinnylicious menu and my sister got the Mac n Cheese Burger. I love the Skinny menu because I usually order apps (all time FAVORITE is the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes - GET THEM) and can still order a meal and not feel like I can&amp;#39;t breathe after. My sister asked to sub out regular fries for sweet potato ones and was told that&amp;#39;s fine however when the food was brought out the woman delivering it said &amp;#34;Oh yeah we don&amp;#39;t have any more sweet potato fries so we gave you regular fries is that ok?&amp;#34; Not having an item is no big deal but bringing the food out and THEN asking if that&amp;#39;s ok when its already in front of the patron? Maybe next time take the time to come out and actually ask if there&amp;#39;s another side she may want instead. Besides that, everything got devoured pretty quickly and afterwards we ordered a piece of our go-to Dulce de Leche cheesecake to share.

A sloppy looking manager with his shirt untucked and stains under his armpits came to the table. Very offensive told us he can not do it. Every time I asked him if they had a pot to boil water he would respond, the pot we use has salt.

As if he was trying to selling me out of buying the pasta. Needless to say my daughter loves pasta.<br&gt;<br&gt;About 15 mins later Kendal returned with a huge smile with the pasta.

Not only did I give this Cheesecake a second chance after a terrible experience with undercooked filet mignon 2 years ago BUT I absolutely blame the restaurant for ruining a surprise birthday dinner I planned for my boyfriend. Let&amp;#39;s start with the fact that this crazy busy joint on a Wednesday night in the middle of the summer does NOT take reservations. So going in there 2 weeks early in the blistering heat and finding out they don&amp;#39;t take reservations was disappointing enough. I had to carry on and plan for my party of 12 to arrive an HOUR early (7PM) and get a table. Well, simple tasks just aren&amp;#39;t simple. As I have someone from my party arrive early , the host tells her the table will take an hour to get. &amp;#34;Perfect,&amp;#34; I thought. Wrong. Not only did I have to stall my boyfriend until 815 PM but my surprise did not go as planned. Since a party of 12 adults for a birthday was not the restaurants top priority (and 3 parties of 4 is) we show up at 830 and the host says another 20 minutes (after telling my friend 10 more minutes when I was on the way). Well of course we had to ask for a manager and OF COURSE that is when magically an open table for 12 appeared. To compensate for the ruined surprised we got FREE NACHOS (yay [NOT] )! The service was nothing to brag about. The food and the drinks were probably the only thing I was satisfied about. To add to my disappointment, I asked the host who should I speak to about sending a cheesecake to the table for the birthday boy. Not only did I tell the host &amp;#34;a whole cheesecake&amp;#34; and that my boyfriend does not like chocolate &amp;amp; to make it a cherry cheesecake, BUT when its time to sing happy birthday, they brought one peice of cake and it was chocolate. One last thing: my friend who came in early, as well as myself, and another person from the party requested seperate checks (to the host, manager, and server). Once that time came our server Shey acted as if it was the end of his cheesecakefactory career to split the checks. Now, I have served tables for over 6 years, I get it, it sucks and its a lot of trouble to do, BUT we were are party of 12 from the ages of 23-30!! We all have jobs and proper morale to know how to TIP SUFFICIENTLY if that&amp;#39;s what the server was worried about. Well anyway to wrap it up, this cheesecake (and most likely others) have lost a customer due to terrible service, lack of priority, and because they disregarded each request I had.

Waiter suggested another tuna dish and after that another tuna dish with the explanation that my friend&amp;#39;s choice was too small. Somehow it turned out into \u00a0a longer discussion and my friend ordered original dish anyway. <br&gt;Salad arrived with a long hair in it. We pulled it out and showed it to the waiter. His reply was that his manager will stop to say &amp;#34;Hello&amp;#34;... It never happened. My crab cakes were undercooked. Bommer! Mashed potatoes were cold. Another bommer!

First off my salad, was just horrible, i don&amp;#39;t know if it was the dressing, veggies, or both but i took one bite and just but that aside. Then came my pizza, it really greasy and really salty. I was pretty disappointed. My sister&amp;#39;s shrimp with angel hair was a fail too. She said it just did not taste good, and she ended up leaving most of it too. <br&gt;And our server took forever to come around with our check and refills and such. It was a busy because of it being lunch time, but the quality of food and slow service, makes me not want to come back. I want to like cheesecake factory, i really do, but I always choose the wrong item and end up being really disappointed. The only thing that redeems Cheesecake factory is their cheesecake, my recent favorite is the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Its Cheesecake and red velvet cake in one. I took it home, but I enjoyed it with a nice glass of milk. It hit the spot. <br&gt;Maybe I should just come here for the cheesecake cause the food has disappointed me one too many times.", "rating": 2, "date": "8/14/2009"}, {"text": "My friend and i went here New years Eve and had a great time.
