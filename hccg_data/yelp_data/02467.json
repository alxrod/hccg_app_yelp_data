If this is the one I think it is (in the prudential center) they have the worst hostesses (sp?) out of any place I&amp;#39;ve seen! \u00a0First of all, there&amp;#39;s probably about 10 \u00a0of them and none of them can do their job right apparently. \u00a0When they call out names of parties, they call them once and sometimes too low to hear! Such was the case when my family went, I thought I heard our name being called. I went up to ask if it was our name...they couldn&amp;#39;t look to see what the last name was called, they just said we had to wait a few more minutes. \u00a0It literally took almost an hour wait when they told us 20 minutes. \u00a0This happened a few more times and even one of the many hostesses said we were the next up. \u00a0We weren&amp;#39;t. \u00a0So we were about to march out of there when we were FINALLY called. \u00a0Service was better after that but WOW, those hostesses need to learn how to do their job.", "rating": 2, "date": "9/20/2010"}, {"text": "the good thing about cheesecake factory is their huuge menu, large portions and excellent service<br&gt;<br&gt;i think the only downside was a typically long wait because the restaurant is so busy! everytime i go there is a long wait for a table.

When we got there, we waited for 5 minutes at the host stand, before being given the &amp;#34;1 minute&amp;#34; finger.<br&gt;The restaurant was empty..but we were seated at an awkward 4 person table in the middle of the room. When my friend asked to switch to a booth, she was told everything was &amp;#34;reserved&amp;#34;. Sidenote: All the booths were empty for the duration of our meal.<br&gt;Our waiter took 5 minutes to come over to us. And another 10 to take our order. Salads reeked of fish and were DROWNING in dressing. We ordered Sweet Potato Fries- Mcd&amp;#39;s style with too much salt. Also, the &amp;#34;fried mac and cheese appetizer&amp;#34;... I thought I was at Cheesecake Factory, not Sonic.<br&gt;We were thinking about dessert, since we were just SO disappointed with our meal and didn&amp;#39;t want to leave on a bad note. But after waiting for him to bring the dessert menus for another 20 minutes, we decided we needed to get out of there.<br&gt;We got a cheesecake at the bakery counter- Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. Oh, and no mention of the fact it was full of pecans.<br&gt;The music was WAY too loud, the crying baby ruined the appetizer, and our waiter was just creepy with a retainer. <br&gt;Almost makes the 12 dollar parking at the Prudential location worth it.", "rating": 1, "date": "3/1/2011"}, {"text": "How can you not like a restaurant that serves cheesecake? \u00a0The portions are huge and the service great! \u00a0Again, how can you not love cheesecake at the end of a meal?", "rating": 4, "date": "7/4/2010"}, {"text": "I grew up in Chestnut Hill and have been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times. Overall it&amp;#39;s been ok from what I remember ten years ago. The last time I went there was a couple of years ago with my sis and it was quite a baffling experience. We were seated quickly and given menus. However, although we saw a waiter attend to all the customers immediately around us, he never once came to my table. My sis and I waited 45 minutes for service, watched the people around us being attended to, while we were blatantly ignored. I don&amp;#39;t want to jump to conclusions, but I will say that the only difference between us and all the patrons around us were that we were the only visible minorities. Anyway, I spoke briefly with the manager about what the rules of his establishment were in terms of who could be served and who could not be. He gave some insincere apology about what happened to us and offered to send gift certificates for us to return. It was pretty clear that he couldn&amp;#39;t care less about our experience and in fact we never saw those gift certificates. My advice: If you&amp;#39;re black, Latino, Indian, Asian, or any other minority, don&amp;#39;t bother with this place.
