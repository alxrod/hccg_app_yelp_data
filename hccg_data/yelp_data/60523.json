She ran back inside and they proceeded to try and kick her out and not give her the item she had paid for. A girl working behind the cheesecake bar (I wish I knew her name) noticed what was going on grabbed her a slice told her not to worry abt it and sent her on her way.

All she wanted was a fancy dinner. We can do that. <br&gt;So.. I called and trued to make a reservation for 11. They dont take them. I spoke to someone who said to have a member of our party arrive an hour early and they will give them an estimated wait time, then that person can call the rest of the group to let then know what time to arrive.

Right on schedule.. the rest of us head on over. <br&gt;<br&gt;At 7:45 they tell him about 35 more minutes. We are now all in the parking lot. I have my daughter, son, and their cousin. They don&amp;#39;t know everyone will be there so we have to sit in the car. 35 minutes. 3 kids. Great. 35 minutes pass. My husband goes to the desk again.

I tell her NO she can&amp;#39;t have milk like that. She apologizes (shocking based on the rest of the experience) and says ok and asks how to spell her name to write it on the plate. I tell her. <br&gt;<br&gt;We are all finished. \u00a0Nobody else orders dessert and we wait maybe like 15 minutes for her to come back WITH ONLY AN ICE CREAM SUNDAE TO SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY DAUGHTER.

Then she tell my daughter, who&amp;#39;s sitting 4 seats down from me, to take a bite. ARE YOU KIDDING ME, LADY? So I yell across the table that she can&amp;#39;t eat milk.

I have never had anything from the menu that I did not like. I tried something newer off the menu and it is out of this world. It&amp;#39;s called pasta campagna. Omg !!! Would highly recommend if you are looking for something different. My daughters always get fettuccini \u00a0Alfredo which is delicious. My wife had the fish tacos which were just as delicious. The staff is fantastic. I want management to know that Michael ( Asian as there are two ) was just fantastic . He went above and beyond to make our dinner just perfect. He truly is an asset to the company. So highly recommended and will back often. Great job Cheesecake Factory !

Our server, although nice, seemed as if she was having an off night. The table next to us that she was serving received the wrong food-she admitted to ringing it up wrong. They were pretty cool with it. She was pretty hard to get a hold of throughout the night as well. <br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 I ordered the jambalaya pasta and my husband ordered the bacon burger. We also started off with Cuban egg rolls as an appetizer. The appetizer was delicious and I was excited for the main course. I received my pasta-the presentation was perfect. And then I started to dig around my dish with my fork. My pasta was pretty much still curled up in spirals and there was no sauce. That&amp;#39;s right. No sauce added at all. This dish has a cream Cajun sauce that makes it-tonight there was none to be found. My husband&amp;#39;s burger was a bit overcooked and the bacon was extra charred, but he dealt with it and just ate it. The fries also tasted kinda stale to me. <br&gt; \u00a0 I alerted the waitress about my pasta with no sauce and she offered to bring out sauce or take it back. We had already been waiting quite a while so I just asked for the sauce. Time goes by. I see my waitress come back with no sauce. Apparently it would have to take another 5 minutes on top of the time I had already waited to make some sauce for me. When the sauce finally arrived it just looked like stewed tomatoes in a bowl. No cream sauce to be found. I just took the tepid runny sauce and poured it myself over the pasta-it made the pasta a bit more edible. <br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 Sigh. I usually have quite good experiences at this Cheesecake Factory, but this time I was only left with a disappointing feeling and leftovers that I really didn&amp;#39;t want.", "rating": 3, "date": "4/19/2015"}, {"text": "My family had a group of 22 people (mostly adults with a few young kids aged 4 months to 15 years old) and this place was fantastic!

However, the manager worked with us to get 11 of us seated. Then an amazing waiter by the name of Steven helped us save two (and then a third) table for our group as the stragglers arrived. The appetizers were brought out promptly. Also, the refills were done without asking a few times which is always a plus! Even when Steven took his break because he was going to work a long shift, the servers and food runners did not skip a beat bringing out out our food, refills, and silverware. The food was delicious as usual. Overall, everything was amazing with our big group which normally is a hassle in a place that doesn&amp;#39;t accept reservations but was a combination of luck, timing, and wonderful service (from the hostess, manager, server - Steve, and the food runners)!

He stated that the manager Chris was indeed in the wrong and offered to give us a gift card to compensate. I agreed because we truly do love the establishment and have no issues ever. Thank you Alex !<br&gt;<br&gt;The Cheesecake Factory is one of our favorite places to eat. Tonight, that changed. Just last week my husband and I went to the Cheesecake Factory at Old Orchard. Service was great, food was great, it was overall a great experience as many of our experiences at CF have been. Tonight we decided to visit the Oak Brook location. What a mistake that was! Let&amp;#39;s start with the slower than usual service. It wasn&amp;#39;t busy, we went around 630 and did not wait for a table. This location was also much darker than any other location oddly enough. I had to use my phone flashlight in the bathroom and the lady at the table next to us used her phone flashlight to read the menu. So we get our drinks. Then our appetizer which was the pork belly sliders and they were delicious to be fair. Next we get our entrees, this is where things get.... hairy. While both entrees (Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic and my husband had over roasted chicken with herbs and butter) \u00a0were actually good, I noticed a hair in mine after a few bites. This hair was not the same color as my hair nor the same length, I turned my flashlight on my phone on and checked to be sure before I made a big deal. So at this point I alert my server (when she finally comes) she apologizes and asks if I want a new one. Well I had most of my meal still so yes I wanted a new one to go. She then walks a few feet away to the manager and implies to him that it was MY hair. Disregarding the complete difference in hair color! The manager, Chris Johansson, comes and apologizes and says they will make a new one to go. Okay this seems okay so far even though I am irritated that I had eaten this meal with hair and the server was very rude. Then we get our bill and the sever says one of the pastas is taken off of the bill and she walks away. Upon looking at the bill we were still charged for the new one they made and the original one with the hair was taken off. I call the server once again and explain that it is not fair that I am being charged for my ruined meal. It&amp;#39;s about 830 at this point! I want to go home. My meal was ruined and now I have to wait for Chris the manager to come back so we can discuss this bill. He comes back and so very rudely asks what the issue is. I explain that I should not be charged for my meal whatsoever because we had been waiting 30 mins for this take home meal and my dinner was still not satisfactory regardless. He says &amp;#34;it was actually about 20 minutes&amp;#34; wow excuse me sir but that is not how you talk to customers that continuously come to your establishment. He offers me a &amp;#34;slice of cheesecake on the house&amp;#34; we just bought two pieces of cheesecake and no that would not have been equivalent to all of this extra drama we went through on top of being a huge waste of time. I then say I will not argue with him and I will also not be paying for the meal. He says &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m not arguing with you okay so I will take the meal off and take the take home plate as well&amp;#34; I say fine and he walks away with the check and the meal. Wow. The server brings our new check and another server takes it and brings it for us to sign. My husband works in the food industry, front of the house and back, so we know the proper way things such as this should be handled. I was not asking for our entire check (about $80) to be comped. I was asking for my dish alone (about $18) to be comped and I think that it was fair to expect that. The manager Chris Johansson was the worst manager I have ever experienced at any restaurant, ever.

It was the 1st time I have ever finished a meal at the CF without feeling like I was going to explode. <br&gt;<br&gt;My wife ordered a side caeser salad (love their dressing), and a lunch portion of a sundried tomato and chicken pasta. When her pasta was delivered, it was covered in a cream sauce which was not mentioned anywhere on the menu (interesting as they have plenty of space for that kind of detail). She requested they make her a new one without cream sauce as she is what I lovingly refer to as a lactard (lactose intolerant). The waitress that dropped off the pasta said something along the lines of &amp;#34;well it always comes with cream sauce on it.&amp;#34; Which I thought was pretty rude, but I let it slide. Our actual waitress came over, apolgized for the mixup and took the pasta to have it remade as requested. The manager also stopped at our table to apologize and offer to bring my wife a complimentary soup which we politely declined.

But note, what do each of these three adjectives have in common? They are all synonyms for BIG or FAT. <br&gt;<br&gt;What really gets me about the Cheesecake Factory is that after countless appeals and the fact that most other national chain restaurants provide nutritional information (some would like it to be required by law), The Cheesecake Factory refuses to do so. Most speculate they do not because their percentage of fat and calories are absurdly high and people would start feeling guilty about dining here. But, I wish they could still be honest about the food that they serve. <br&gt;<br&gt;With that out in the air, my experience with service at the Oak Brook location has been okay. But on my last visit, I was going for a quick dinner at the bar, where they serve &amp;#34;light&amp;#39; portions of meals at awesome prices. I love their Thai Wraps, and wanted to get the happy hour priced portion (for like $4.00 you can&amp;#39;t resist!). Upon arriving, I mentioned I was here for happy hour and the hostess told me to pick a seat in the bar area.<br&gt;<br&gt; It took nearly 10 minutes for a waiter to even come to our high top table to ask us what we wanted to drink. (the bar tender meanwhile was behind the bar 2 feet away from us reading the paper!). We ordered our food. I pointed at the bar menu listing of the smaller portion discounted Thai Wraps when I ordered.<br&gt;<br&gt; It takes quite awhile for even our glasses of wine comes. The waiters excuse was &amp;#34;oh sorry, I was in the back chatting with the manager&amp;#34;. um okay?<br&gt;<br&gt; When we got our order, my Thai Wraps were HUGE, definitely not the small happy hour protion. I noted this, and the waiter said &amp;#34;yes, they&amp;#39;re always that big&amp;#34;. So, I gave him the benefit of \u00a0the doubt. This was the first time I had ordered them at the Oak Brook location. <br&gt;<br&gt;But low and behold, once we got our bill I was charged the full price. We I asked the waiter, he said that he was sorry. that&amp;#39;s it. I asked if we could be charged the Happy Hour price and he said &amp;#34;I guess I could ask the manager, but you already ate it&amp;#34;. <br&gt;<br&gt;UGH, because I already questioned HIM about it! Why else would we sit in the bar, say we were there for happy hour, order off the happy hour menu, and then ask why it was so big when it came?<br&gt;<br&gt;Okay, but that was just one experience.

The jobs are very specialized. One person took our reservation, another seated us, a third took our orders, yet another person served our food. We had avocado egg rolls with a tamarisk/cashew sauce; fantastic! I had breaded fried shrimp that were really good sized and delicious. They were served with Cole Slaw and French fries.
