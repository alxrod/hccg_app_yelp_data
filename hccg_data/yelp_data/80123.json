Quick order. Quick eaters and know what we are doing. \u00a0In the biz so we wouldn&amp;#39;t annoy anyone until hella late. <br&gt;<br&gt;Whole experience is meh. It&amp;#39;s beneath us to tip less than 20% but that&amp;#39;s how we roll. Being in this business you just don do that. Even when service is subpar or worse. I wish bartenders took more pride in what they&amp;#39;re doing. Only people at the bar. She only had service well. Mediocre shake.. soggy olives as if they climbed out of a strip club. Didn&amp;#39;t check on apps. Didn&amp;#39;t check on refills. Didn&amp;#39;t try to up sell booze (what?) upon ordering a top shelf martini was offered a well.. actually attempted to down sell.... I mean.. what&amp;#39;s next you&amp;#39;re gonna talk someone out of a double on their first drink also? Come on. Just no urgency. No common sense in making money for a company you work for or for your own tip. Didn&amp;#39;t check on entrees.. I went and got some shitty black table pepper myself from a high top. Cleared ourselves. Places Bev naps ourselves.. doing a ton of secret shopper visits for work this was really a joke. Also service that approaches with a sense of familiarity.

The refills on sodas we didn&amp;#39;t get and no offer on another round of alcoholic bevs, as we were waiting for to go bags and cc was long on top of the receipts.. we suddenly got acknowledged!

You should really take pride in what you do no matter who&amp;#39;s behind you and their status. But that&amp;#39;s where work ethic takes a different path. Some of us are not meant to kick ass and take names. Some are not high ringers. On a $60 tab $15 bucks when there&amp;#39;s no one there should make a difference for someone that&amp;#39;s working a pm shift. But maybe not. Sad thing is you add another round of drinks which we were clearly ready for.. shots before we went bowling and two desserts we wanted to grab but never got the menu and bam! That&amp;#39;s your sales you should care about. That&amp;#39;s your tip you should worry about.

While I&amp;#39;m typically not a big fan of chain restaurants, CCF is usually pretty good. We did have a large party of 8, so I figured it would be a long wait for a table. In addition, I also assumed there would be some hiccups in the service considering they had only been open a week. When we finally got seated after an hour and 15-minute wait, it took FOREVER for anyone to even come to our table. Like, probably almost 15 minutes...just to get our drink order! I ordered a glass of the Matua Sauvignon Blanc which was $2 cheaper per glass than the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc. I love Kim Crawford, but sorry - I&amp;#39;m not spending $10.50 a glass when I can get a bottle for $13 at Costco. I also asked her the difference between the regular chicken salad sandwich and the Skinnylicious chicken salad sandwich, as there was $1 difference in price and nothing looked different in the 2 descriptions. She said the only difference was that it came with salad instead of fries. I asked her to clarify because the regular one, you also have the option of getting salad instead of fries. She said that was it. Fast forward 55 minutes (yes 55 minutes because that&amp;#39;s how long it took to get our food once we&amp;#39;d ordered), and here were the issues. I went with the Skinnylicious version of my sandwich because I always get salad with it anyway, and it was barely even HALF the size of their regular portion. I was basically starving at that point, so I wasn&amp;#39;t super thrilled to get half the amount of food for only $1 less. Also there was maybe a tiny drizzle of dressing on the tiny salad. They brought the wrong thing completely for one person in our party, but she didn&amp;#39;t want to wait any longer so she just ate it. The manager did come over and apologize for the food taking so long but it was all of 3 minutes before it actually did come out. I asked our server when she came back to the table if the sandwich was smaller than the regular portion (because hello, I&amp;#39;d specifically asked her what the difference was between the 2 and this wasn&amp;#39;t mentioned), and she said, &amp;#34;Yes it&amp;#39;s smaller, but it is the Cheesecake Factory so all of our portions are big here.&amp;#34; ?!? Okayyyyyyy, thanks for the lecture, and you should have told me that to begin with because I would have spent the extra $1 and gotten the amount of food I was expecting. At the end of our 2+-hour dining experience, we receive the check. And she had charged me for the Kim Crawford wine rather than the Matua that I&amp;#39;d ordered. When she tried to argue with me, 3 people at my table confirmed they&amp;#39;d heard me order the Matua. Mind you, it was family I was with, so if I&amp;#39;d ordered the wrong thing and didn&amp;#39;t realize it, they definitely would have told me. She huffed off to adjust the bill and was rude to everyone the last few minutes we were there.

So far this place has been a total disappointment. We have gone twice. The first time was just before Christmas and they had not been open long.

They are in a mall so you would think they would have a way to page you anywhere in the mall. Everyone has cell phone and a simple text should suffice. But they only have the standard blinking pager. This you can&amp;#39;t get as far as the main mall hallway. So you have to stand for two hours or just guess. We guessed and made it back 30 minutes early only to be told it would be another hour and a half. That is a 3 hour total wait!

The apologies profusely and compped us desert (great idea for a diabetic). But I decided to give them a second chance. They were new and it was the holidays. Mid January we tried again. Once we decided not to wait again for a 2 hour wait (once bitten, twice). Next time we went back at 4:00 on Saturday we didn&amp;#39;t have long of a wait.
