The allegedly spicy Louisiana Chicken Pasta was bland, with dry breaded chicken. The Chicken Enchiladas tasted nothing like Mexican food, almost as if they were topped with canned tomato sauce with a sickly sweet taste we couldn&amp;#39;t place. Everything tasted clearly reheated, further proven by the too-hot-to-touch plate of the enchiladas. These taste like frozen microwave entrees, in huge portions, carefully plated. The menu tries to be everything for everyone with hundreds of items, serving the &amp;#34;Factory&amp;#34; moniker well, but one must wonder how much of it is successful. <br&gt;<br&gt;The cheesecake with strawberries was the one positive, but our enthusiasm waned when we realized the center was frozen.<br&gt;<br&gt;And that dinner perfectly sums up the proposition of Cheesecake Factory.

There is very ample and very comfortable seating inside as well as a small outdoor patio dining area which is nice. The d\u00e9cor and the overall ambiance gives this place an upscale feel and the entire staff is friendly and attentive. But while the place has an upscale look and vibe, it is really just your average chain restaurant with good PR. However, that good PR makes their prices a bit steeper than places like an Applebee&amp;#39;s or Ruby Tuesday&amp;#39;s. The appetizers here average around $10.50 and the main dishes around $19.00. For two people each ordering an appetizer, main dish, beverage and one dessert to split, you can easily drop $60-$75 per person before the tip. If you order alcohol, jack that price up much higher.<br&gt;<br&gt;As for the food itself. Let&amp;#39;s start with the menu. It is 20 pages long! You have so much to choose from the decision is staggering. I have been there half a dozen times and tried something different each time. At that rate it may well take a few hundred visits to put even a dent in the menu. Whatever you&amp;#39;re in the mood for, you can find something here.<br&gt;<br&gt;The quality of the food is good to very good. The preparation and presentation are excellent. The portions are a bit on the smallish side compared to other chains, especially when you consider the price, but they are still enough to enjoy adequately, though you will have room for dessert (that may be the point).<br&gt;<br&gt;Some negatives, if you go at peak days/times, you might have quite a wait, it could be an hour. I have only had a wait on one trip, it was 25 minutes. Another inconsistency is the prep time to get your meal. I have had a meal arrive anywhere from 15 minutes to over 35 minutes from the time of ordering, and it did not seem to matter if the place was busy or not with the longer waits.<br&gt;<br&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s get to the part where this place simply shines; the desserts! As their name implies, this place has the most amazing and decadent selection of cheesecakes you can possibly imagine, and then some. A full three pages of the menu is dedicated to their cheesecakes, specialty desserts, specialty coffees, iced and frozen drinks ice cream creations and shakes. If you have a sweet tooth, you will think you have died and gone to sugar heaven! And the prices are very reasonable, much more so than their regular menu items, averaging $7.50 per item. You can also buy whole cheesecakes from their display cases.<br&gt;<br&gt;The dessert portions are generous too. One piece of cheesecake is more than enough for one person, and can be split between two and still give each of you enough to enjoy. I love cheesecake in general and this place makes them an art. I have had theirs on three of my trips, though I am not normally one for dessert.<br&gt;<br&gt;Bottom line is the food is on average, very good, the portions a bit smallish, but if you include dessert, you will not leave hungry. The service from the staff is excellent and the desserts exceptional. They are quite pricey on the food and beverages for a chain retaurant, but great on the desserts. The wait times to be seated or served are hit and miss. If it were up to me alone, I would only go here for the desserts and have my meal at another, less costly chain, but my girlfriend loves the place and she&amp;#39;s worth the extra cost.", "rating": 3, "date": "9/27/2016"}, {"text": "45 minutes for 2 half-loaves of cold, hard bread!!

(Or at the very least do a &amp;#34;trial period&amp;#34; of this concept at select spots and see what sort of response they get from both customers, employees, \u00a0&amp;amp; sales). They could call, email, and/or text also, to confirm the details, so as to avoid no shows etc. I think this would encourage more business for them &amp;amp; happy customers overall.

When my friend and I went to the Cheesecake Factory last year it was a very scary first experience. My friend was eating the portabella mushroom, avocado and zucchini fries when she realized that there were pieces of metal wire in her food. We complained to a manager about the issue. The manager explained to us that the wire baskets used to cook the fried food must have frayed and that explains why the wire was in the food. They said they would fix the problem and that they would change to newer baskets. They ended up refunding our money for the appetizer but that was all that was offered to us. Thankfully my friend did not choke or swallow the medal wire. It could have been very dangerous. After that my friend and I lost our appetite. We paid for our bill and left without finishing our food. <br&gt;<br&gt;A year later I received a gift card to the Cheesecake Factory and decided to give it a second chance. My friend and I decided to go there for lunch on Saturday. It was very crowded. When we walked up to the hostess counter she barely greeted us or looked us and instructed the other hostess to seat us at table number 70. She never asked if we wanted a booth or a table. The table was very small and very close to the people next to us. Before we could complain or ask to be moved, the hostess walked away from us without asking us if we liked the table. It was very uncomfortable to be sitting that close to the other table. Since the hostess was no where in sight, my friend and I decided to take matters into our own hands and we moved ourselves to one of the empty private booths. After a couple of minutes, the hostess noticed we moved to another table. She came over to us, took our menus away from us and told us that there is a waiting list for a booth. After getting treated poorly and feeling like the hostess embarrassed us, we left the restaurant and decided to cool off for a bit. I didn&amp;#39;t want the gift card to go to waste so I went back inside and put my name on the waiting list for a booth. After 20 minutes I got a text message and retuned back into the restaurant to be seated. It took another 10 minutes to be seated. It also took a while for the waitress to come to our table to take our drink and food order. We had ceasar salads, which weren&amp;#39;t bad but the salad dressing was a little on the strong side. Since the place is called the Cheesecake Factory we decided to give the cheesecakes a try. We ordered the original cheesecake and the dulce de leche caramel cheesecake. Neither of us finished our cheesecakes. They tasted very sour. It was the worst cheesecake I&amp;#39;ve ever had. <br&gt;<br&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if its just the Trumbull location but I feel like the Cheesecake Factory is very overhyped and overpriced.
