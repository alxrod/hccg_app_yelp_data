Full of flavor and a huge serving, I always make a mistake of ordering something for myself instead then sharing with my girlfriend.

The day I heard they opened this place here in Albuquerque my home I almost broke down and cried in joy. I&amp;#39;d previously visited the other locations in Denver, and various ones in Texas and it always bummed we out that we didn&amp;#39;t have one. I was so delighted that we finally got it. Sadly this is actually only my second visit to the one at home. In all the time it&amp;#39;s been open. Why? Well let&amp;#39;s start off by saying this place can be pricey. A slice of their own cheesecake can easily run you $8. Wow! Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong the food I&amp;#39;ve had is quite delicious and has not let me down but it&amp;#39;s definitely not somewhere I find myself going on a weekly basis. We had gone during peak hours at 6 in the evening which I was hesitant as I know how busy that place can be. Luckily our wait was about 15 minutes and we were seated in the outdoor patio. We had a little visitor (pigeon) stop by our table and walking around scrounging for food it was funny. Our waitress came about 8 minutes later to take our drink orders and arrived with the drinks 6 minutes later which was enough time to decide what to order. I decided this visit I would change it up and order something different. I tried their fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. I&amp;#39;m a creature of habit and I find myself ordering the same thing that I enjoy at different places. Alfredo is a hit or miss with me. There are only a small handful of places I find to have a good fettuccine Alfredo. I felt bold this go around so when it arrived I could smell the aroma of creamy Alfredo and chicken. The noodles on the top of the dish were a little chewy but the rest of the noodles were pretty soft. The noodles unfortunately did not hold up well when twisted with guidance of the spoon. I found the noodles to break easily and not twist well. The Alfredo itself was very creamy and with the cheese they spread on top it wasn&amp;#39;t watery or too thick. Sometimes I&amp;#39;ve found some places to have a thick Alfredo that doesn&amp;#39;t soak well with the noodles. Cheesecake Factory had it just right. The chicken was good but it did feel a bit tough and dry like chicken you&amp;#39;ll find in a progresso soup can. It as freshly cooked just a little tough. If the chicken had been more softer and juicer I would&amp;#39;ve enjoyed it more. My friend wanted spaghetti and meatballs but our waitress informed us they were out of the meatballs but suggested another dish that was similar with alternative meat. I forgot what is called honestly but my friend gave me taste and it was ok but I&amp;#39;m not much of spaghetti fan. Overall we had great service, and the food was decent. This place can be a bit pricey so be prepared to at least spend anywhere between $15 to $30 a dish depending on what you want so fair warning. I definitely recommend coming least to get the experience and enjoy one of their delicious cheesecakes!", "rating": 4, "date": "5/19/2019"}, {"text": "Okay, so...obviously I&amp;#39;ve been to dozens of these places before. The problem was I wasn&amp;#39;t Yelping back when I lived in Oklahoma and would frequent this place constantly every other weekend when I would drive up to the capitol. If I were, I would tell you guys that they are just as amazing as ever, regardless of which one you go to. But the experience varies based on service. The food is almost always good. Usually.<br&gt;<br&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk about the first night I went to the Cheesecake Factory here in the land of enchantment. I ordered the shrimp scampi, which is a bistro take on the traditional dish. Basically, it&amp;#39;s deep fried shrimp in a scampi sauce. In this iteration, everything as far as the sauce was spot on. Unfortunately, they took the misstep of burning some of the shrimp. So I thought to myself, &amp;#34;okay...everyone has a bad night. no biggie. I&amp;#39;ll let it pass.&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;I mean, we were already planning on returning here our last night in Albuquerque, we love the place that much.<br&gt;<br&gt;This second visit, I was determined to try the steak diane. But I didn&amp;#39;t want that to be the only protein I had, just in case I didn&amp;#39;t like it for whatever reason. So I got the factory combo of shrimp scampi (almost everyone deserves a second chance, after all) and the steak diane.<br&gt;<br&gt;Firstly, I am happy to report that the scampi was MUCH better this time around. All the shrimp were cooked perfectly with nothing singed or burnt. The sauce was just like I remember it. Plus it all blended beautifully with the mashed potatoes. Yeah...the combos come with mashed and Cheesecake Factory actually makes a damn good mashed.<br&gt;<br&gt;That said, we can discuss the steak diane. It was....different for me. Took some getting used to because honestly, I have nothing else to compare it to. I&amp;#39;ve never really had a steak diane before, much less know much about it. I know that it&amp;#39;s a recipe generally consisting of a pan seared steak of sorts, tossed in a mushroom-ish sauce with black peppercorn and onions. Only the sauce Cheesecake Factory uses is slightly sweet. Again, not quite what I was expecting. But overall, it wasn&amp;#39;t bad. At least I had the benefit of the mashed potatoes to counterbalance the mild sweetness brought on by the sauce.<br&gt;<br&gt;The steak itself was cooked a perfect medium as requested. But you&amp;#39;ll notice from the pic I took that they serve this steak *almost* hibachi style. That&amp;#39;s what it reminded me of really. Most places just leave the whole piece of steak uncut. This one came in pieces. Not really a deal breaker for me; just....different.<br&gt;<br&gt;I know that some of you will probably scream bloody murder when I confess this. But no...I did not order any cheesecake either visit. The main reason being is I&amp;#39;m not much of a dessert guy. And even when I am, it&amp;#39;s WAY after the fact. The thing is I just genuinely get way too full to consider dessert immediately after dinner. I mean...who, over the age of 12 that isn&amp;#39;t female, eats dessert *immediately* after dinner? Really. Guys...my metabolism isn&amp;#39;t what it used to be.<br&gt;<br&gt;The ultimate takeaway from all this is simple: if you happen to be in a town or near a town that has a Cheesecake Factory in it, you are absolutely CRAZY not to go! They pretty much never miss the mark when it comes to the actual recipes. The only thing that could ruin your experience would be if you got subpar service. So stop on by! It will change your life.

I got a burger, my husband got chicken Parm sandwich, and my son got pizza. Burger was surprisingly good, and my husband and son both demolished their lunch as well. Soda refills were sporadic, and honestly it was a half-step above Chili&amp;#39;s. Good but not worth the work of standing in line and shivering on the side patio. <br&gt;<br&gt;The second time was much better, on a noon lunch. My friend had the club salad and I had the ahi tuna salad. Really tasty and fresh, and we had better seats by the bar. The cheesecake is FABULOUS (it was my friend&amp;#39;s birthday so we had to indulge!) We got a variety with caramel on top and finished very last bite.

First, they&amp;#39;re &amp;#34;out of beer&amp;#34;--something about being out of CO2.. they&amp;#39;re also out of the artichoke appetizer.

We specifically told the server we wanted to enjoy our appetizer before the entrees. Even after waiting to order entrees, our appetizer was out only 2 minutes before they flung entrees onto our table as well. I suppose that was a good thing because we had no appetizer plates and had been eating the bread using our menus as plates beforehand. Asked for another bread basket from the food runner that never arrived. Asked for more toast for the crab dip appetizer that took another 15 minutes so the dip was cold by the time that came out. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now on to the entrees-- chicken pasta my friend ordered tasted as if they spilled a cup of sugar on top.

I asked the hostess if the patio was heated (I couldn&amp;#39;t remember) and was told yes, so we said first available. \u00a0Because of it, we were seated in about half the quoted time on the patio. \u00a0However, although it is heated, the heaters are up on the ceiling of the covered patio, and as the patio is not completely enclosed (it&amp;#39;s open on the ends), the heaters didn&amp;#39;t do much to combat the chill in the air. \u00a0There were additional floor heaters located OUTSIDE the peremeter of the patio, but they provided no additional heat, as the shades were closed and we were sitting by the opposite wall away from them. \u00a0We decided to stick with it because we didn&amp;#39;t want to be put back on the list to wait for another table. \u00a0My husband went to the car to get our jackets which helped a bit. \u00a0I understand that having the additional patio seating helps with wait times, but if the restaurant can&amp;#39;t provide adequate heat in colder weather on the patio, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be utilized. \u00a0On top of that, the service on the patio was pretty inattentive. \u00a0Our server was very pleasant, but unfortunately not very efficient. \u00a0I&amp;#39;m thinking he was probably having to juggle waiting tables inside as well as the patio, but the service on the patio suffered because of it. \u00a0My husband and I ordered iced teas (yes, I know I just said that we were chilly on the patio, but we like the tea here), and we were asked if we wanted bread, which of course we said yes, please. \u00a0A while later we get our teas and place our dinner orders. \u00a0The server leaves and I go to reach for the sweatener when I realize there is none on the table or any of the surrounding tables that I can see. \u00a0Our server came back with the bread some time later, and I asked for some sweetener for the tea, and the server leaves to go fetch some, or so I think, but he must have gotten sidetracked as I don&amp;#39;t see him for a while. \u00a0Meanwhile, we have bread and butter, but no bread plates and no silverware. \u00a0We start eating it anyway and just scooping up the butter in the dish with the bread as we have no knives to spread it with. \u00a0We finish the bread, and eventually our server comes back to let us know our meals should be up soon. \u00a0I asked again for some sweetener, which to his credit he did apologize for and returned with. \u00a0Our meals come out, everything looks good and is just as we ordered. \u00a0We still don&amp;#39;t have silverware, but as we both ordered sandwiches, we didn&amp;#39;t need it. \u00a0I did ask for some napkins, which we got after asking. \u00a0After we were done eating, the server brings a dessert menu and we each order a different kind of cheesecake. \u00a0Our server returns again a while later to let me know that they were out of the cheesecake I ordered. \u00a0No biggie, and luckily I had a second choice picked out already and didn&amp;#39;t need to see the menu again. \u00a0So he goes off and returns what seems like a rather long time later with our cheesecake and some forks. \u00a0I definitely don&amp;#39;t fault the server for being out of one of the desserts, but the amount of time we went without seeing the server seemed long throughout the meal. Another issue is that our drinks were never refilled once during the time we were seated. \u00a0One entree, one appetizer (I ordered it as a meal), two slices of cheesecake and literally two glasses of iced tea (since we never got refills on them) came to about $50.00, which is too expensive to eat in the cold and be forgotten. \u00a0I will still be inclined to get cheesecake to go on occasion, but for all the fuss surrounding this place, I expected better.", "rating": 2, "date": "1/15/2018"}, {"text": "I&amp;#39;m so disappointed with the food here.

I still work in the customer service industry in another capacity and understand that there are times when things are out of your control. And then there are other times when the experience is made poor because of a lazy or poor server. Unfortunately tonight a one star rating is being quite generous.<br&gt;<br&gt;We had a group of 13 guys out for dinner and drinks to celebrate a day off work. The service was poor at best, our server made no mention of any specials, prefaced by saying bread would take awhile to come out and assumed we all wanted water to drink when he first greeted the table. He simply could have asked our drink order and appetizer order and got the night started. Unprofessional table greet and start. Furthermore when we said we wanted to order some appetizers, he only took our liquor orders and then left. By the time he realized he hadn&amp;#39;t taken the appetizer order (15min or so) we had decided to just place a food order. Instead of taking our food order when we said we weren&amp;#39;t going to order our appetizers and just food, he walked away AGAIN to get our drinks instead of getting our food order. Furthermore upon delivering our drinks he made the comment to one of the guys &amp;#34;that our drinks are strong so pace yourself, I don&amp;#39;t want to have to cut you off&amp;#34;....not sure the reason for this unprofessional comment.<br&gt;<br&gt;After receiving our drinks we assumed the bread that was &amp;#34;still cooking in the oven&amp;#34; (as told to us by our server) would be coming shortly. Another 10 minutes passed. When the bread arrived it wasn&amp;#39;t even hot. So either he was lying to us about the bread cooking or he was lazy. Furthermore he brought us enough bread for a group of 6 people...maybe. He asked for more bread and he only brought it to one end of the table. <br&gt;<br&gt;With our food order in, we decided to have another round of drinks. Our server at this point made the comment that he couldn&amp;#39;t allow us more than one drink per hour because he wouldn&amp;#39;t want to cut us off. We had been here at the restaurant for over an hour and was on our 2nd round. Quite unprofessional and honestly uncalled for. We weren&amp;#39;t even close to intoxicated and if anything super frustrated at the poor service we were receiving and yet STILL ordering $10-14 cocktails for our group.<br&gt;<br&gt;Finally after being told on 2 different occasions that our food would be right out, it arrived about 40min after our order. I can understood a groups long ticket time but instead of an apology for the wait or anything...maybe even a manager stopping by...we got nothing. On top of all of that, the guy who was paying for the entire meal did not get his food until everyone was FINISHED eating their meal. He ordered a burger :/ seriously <br&gt;<br&gt;Our server said he&amp;#39;d try to make it up to us with a slice of cheesecake or something. And yet he didn&amp;#39;t have a manager stop by to say sorry or do anything to make up for it. We had 13 people order dinner and 3 rounds of drinks. You do the math on the tab. Furthermore he didn&amp;#39;t even do a dessert presentation or insist on the cheesecake slice because of his blunder with the burger.<br&gt;<br&gt;Finally after getting the check and getting ready to leave, the gentleman who was paying the tab for our company outing spoke to the manager on our way out the door. Her only response was &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m sorry.&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;She offered to do NOTHING to accommodate the poor service and lackluster experience on a MONDAY night. <br&gt;<br&gt;To say the ball was dropped on this experience would be a generously kind way of venting frustration.

It seemed as if they had made a big pot of it and we got the serving that was scraped out of the bottom of the pot. It would have been good if the chicken chunks were larger and they used whole shrimp instead of chopped up shrimp. There were also no vegetables which I thought was strange... The pepperonis on the pizza were all burned around the edges, which thankfully, my picky toddler did not complain about. \u00a0He had an upset stomach shortly after eating, which I am wondering could be related to the pizza he ate??

When we first walked in we expected the crowd at the front so we were ready to wait until we were told we could sit in the bar area which we took full advantage of and thought to ourselves SCORE!... no wait. A couple of minutes later our waitress greeted us and took our drink order. Ten minutes later we got our drinks and placed our order right away so there wouldn&amp;#39;t be too much of a delay since the place was getting busy. 35-40 minutes later we received our entrees, we could tell our waitress left them sitting for a while because the top was cold and it wasn&amp;#39;t until we stirred them that they actually were warm enough to eat. During the 35 minutes that we waited we saw our waitress a couple of times and she kept telling us they were still working on our order then she disappeared for a while--the adjacent waitress could probably tell we were becoming aggravated and she came over to check on us and offered to refill our drinks which we were thankful for since our own waitress didn&amp;#39;t do so. In fact, we waited so long, the tables that were seated after us received their food 10-15 minutes before we did. Our waitress never apologized for the wait nor did she offer anything else, she dropped off our food and disappeared again. Once we finished she promptly brought us our check, she wasted no time ringing us up--I wish she would have been that quick with our food. I have to give credit to this place for having an amazing atmosphere, the d\u00e9cor is beautiful and comfortable even though it was really busy during our visit. Also, once we received our food, the taste was great and the portion just right. I&amp;#39;m not sure what it&amp;#39;s going to take to fix the service and attitude of the workers at this location, none (except for the adjacent waitress) seemed to care, even the on duty manager didn&amp;#39;t seemed bothered by the mounting complaints as we saw him comping checks from other unhappy customers. I suppose we could have complained to him directly and maybe had our check comped as well but judging by his attitude and the way he disrespecfully rolled his eyes at the customers he comped, it would have been a waste and I would have had some choice words for him if he rolled his eyes at me as well so we instead called it a loss and left. This is by far the most mismanaged location I have ever been to-- there needs to be change from the top. Prior to posting this review I read previous reviews and more importantly the responses from the &amp;#34;business manager&amp;#34; to all the complaints posted on this forum which amounted to no more than a poor excuse for an apology to my fellow yelpers, I honestly expect the same lacking response to this posting.

With a wait up to 3 hours for a party of two. That is the first thing the hostess told us when we walking in the door. \u00a0The city was excited for the new addition to the city restaurants. The outside of the building was eye drawing especially because it is in the Mall shopping center. It was the new hot spot that is now open from 11am-11pm and Friday - Saturday extender their closing till 12:30. <br&gt; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The week of opening I waiting two hours to be seated for a party of two. When I was seated I waited another 30 minutes for someone to take my drink order. I then began to get frustrated. Not being able to have service also well waiting that was irritating.

The food turned out amazing everything came fast and was just like it appeared to be in the picture. The service eventually turned out to be better. And well having our meals completely gave to us for free. Not having to pay even for a soda.

New servers and a new business is a lot to take in. The company is a great company the servers, manager, hostess, and everyone else was very nice and welcoming. The manager you could see was very stressed out and just needed a break before he completely broke down. This issue was not in his control, he had a 3 hour wait waiting outside. There&amp;#39;s not more the man could do but stay calm and do what he did by making sure everyone was to be pleased and also happy. The meals we order was a chicken pasta which my mother got. I got a bacon cheese burger that had tasted like the most amazing bacon ever! I was very pleased with the burger. \u00a0<br&gt;The Cheesecake Factory in Albuquerque, New Mexico turned out to be a great dinner and a huge hit! The food was amazing. It came out looking just like it did on the menu for the restaurant. \u00a0Everyone in New Mexico loved it and online it had no bad reviews. We New Mexicans were happy to have something new and something only other states had. This turned out to be a benefiting change for the City. I will love to attend the Cheesecake Factory again in the future. \u00a0I give this The Cheese Cake Factory a rating of a 4 out of 5 just because after everything the food was still amazing.
