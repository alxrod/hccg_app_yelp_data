The same social distance signs were on the bar so I asked if your open and the bartender said yes. A few minutes later a couple sat at the bar also.

I&amp;#39;d never seen it so disorganized and a server that was so uninterested in serving the diners. He was dry from the moment I arrived and ended the visit by not speaking to me. It was very unprofessional. He would take forever to come to the table and when he did I asked for condiments. He responded by saying &amp;#34;Is that it?&amp;#34; And proceeded to walk away. About 10 minutes later when he returned he didn&amp;#39;t have everything. I was growing impatient. So I asked for a Caesar Salad Togo because I never got the condiments I&amp;#39;d asked for. He said he would bring me a Togo box. Everyone knows you can&amp;#39;t take a salad with dressing on it to go. It withers. I asked the manager as she was visiting the table next to me about the salad. Side note: They were on their second steak that was prepared incorrectly. The next time I saw the server he just dropped my Togo salad and ticket on the table. He didn&amp;#39;t speak. He just walked off with his head turned away from me. For a $20 sandwich and salad, they need to hire more carefully. <br&gt;<br&gt;Also, my table (or the neighboring tables) was never cleaned off. My drink was empty. I went through 3 sets of silverware to get a clean fork and knife. <br&gt;<br&gt;Previous rating: 4<br&gt;I visited this location multiple times. The good thing about it is that the food is pretty consistent. The bad part is the menu is so big and diverse and can be hard to decide. The large menu probably contributes to the taste of the food. They don&amp;#39;t have a good specialty. So some items can be extremely bland for the price. I have a couple of items I eat every time I visit and those are great. I LOVE THE CLUB and CEASAR SALAD. It&amp;#39;s great. They also had a shrimp club and crab cake sandwich that were delicious. They also have good drinks at the bar. <br&gt;<br&gt;The service is good (dine-in and take-out). There can be a long wait and parking can be an issue depending on the day/time. I personally just park in the mall parking deck and walk through the mall to the restaurant.

Even when a touch burnt and not completely uniform in size, it was pretty solid. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Chicken Riesling is a mix of chicken, bacon, onions, and a creamy sauce with pasta. To me, that hits basically all my happy notes. I don&amp;#39;t know if it does for you. <br&gt;<br&gt;Their cheesecake is also pretty solid, and the Sour Cream top works well for it, although I&amp;#39;m not really a huge sour cream fan.<br&gt;<br&gt;I would probably have given this four stars, but the fifth star comes from the chef caring enough to actually pre-empt any concern of mine and deliver another appetizer that didn&amp;#39;t meet their own standard.

The asparagus was amazing and so were the potatoes. But I found myself picking through the chicken to find good pieces. Maybe I just had a bad batch.

The waiter does not reflect the experience that I had, he was great! I asked the waiter his opinion on the crab bites. He said that they were good and he doesn&amp;#39;t even eat seafood. So I order them and they came out quickly but to my dismay they were disgusting. I sent them back and ordered the brussels sprouts. They came and they were tasty until I realized they were dry on the 2nd bite; the Brussel sprouts did not have the sauce that was described in the menu. The table was dirty that I noticed after we sat for a while but to top it all off, you wouldn&amp;#39;t believe that the hamburger kids meal that I ordered for my three-year-old daughter that the meat was spoiled. I tasted it and spit it out immediately and even had the waiter tastic who confirmed it was spoiled. They took off the kids meal but at this point I just felt like my entire bill should&amp;#39;ve been cut which was equivalent to $23. I called over the manager and explained my horrible experience and she said because I&amp;#39;d eat in the brussels sprouts she couldn&amp;#39;t count that off. \u00a0I let her know I will never be returning.", "rating": 1, "date": "7/3/2019"}, {"text": "The food here is always below standard.

It&amp;#39;s My go-to for many dinner dates and afternoons with friends. <br&gt;A party of 2 can expect 20 minute - 1 hour wait times on a Friday or Saturday night. Valet is available on these nights, and it&amp;#39;s recommended since parking spaces are few and far between. \u00a0The large fountain courtyard is a good place for your party to relax and chat while awaiting a table if sitting at the bar isn&amp;#39;t of interest.<br&gt;<br&gt;Like all Cheesecake Factory&amp;#39;s, portions are huge, the selections are extensive, the ambiance is lively but romantic under some circumstances, and the interior decor is beautifully designed.<br&gt;The soaring mural ceiling and large windows (which are promptly shaded upon sunset) really give the place a sense of spaciousness. There&amp;#39;s an outdoor dining patio scattered with powerful heat lamps so diners can enjoy it even during really chilly evenings, it it also quieter than indoors.<br&gt;<br&gt;I always seem to order the same thing, despite the vast number of items on the \u00a0menu. <br&gt;When I have ventured to try other items, I haven&amp;#39;t been disappointed.<br&gt;My favorite order is the Thai Lettuce Wraps followed by a Chinese Chicken Salad. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Thai lettuce wraps are insanely good and the portion is more than plentiful, it is a meal in itself. There are large lettuce leaves (iceberg and a purple variety?) which you fill with Satay chicken, shredded carrots, bean sprouts, and noodle strings. It is served with 3 different Thai-inspired dipping sauces, they are so delicious, I always order extras of each. Things will get messy with these wraps, but I promise that you wont even care!<br&gt;Other favorite appetizers are the Firecracker Salmon Rolls, Avocado Eggrolls, and Buffalo Blasters - they&amp;#39;re awesome and great to share. The Ahi Carpaccio (raw tuna with wasabi and avocado cream) is also wonderful.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Chinese Chicken Salad mountain makes a grand entrance, it is piled high!<br&gt;Crispy rice noodles and wontons, savory grilled chicken, mandarin orange slices, sesame seeds and other toppings grace this delicious Asian-inspired salad. The tasty Chinese plum dressing really sets it off. Yum. <br&gt;<br&gt;Their orange chicken is pretty good too, it&amp;#39;s not actually spicy though and I wish the sauce was heavier. Same goes for their Bang-Bang chicken &amp;amp; shrimp and the Caramel Chicken (which I ordered sans-mushroom) entrees. <br&gt;<br&gt;The best way to order your drinks is directly at the bar, the bar also offers the perfect diversion if you&amp;#39;re stuck waiting for a table. They have added a &amp;#34;Skinny Drink&amp;#34; menu, and many other drinks can be made &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; as well. <br&gt;On the &amp;#34;Skinny&amp;#34; note, I once ordered the grilled artichoke, it was surprisingly tasty. <br&gt;<br&gt;Once you&amp;#39;re seated, even if the place is packed and service is slower than usual, you&amp;#39;ll be given a complimentary basket of 2 sliced bread loafs with sweet butter to accompany them. The basket will be replenished upon request.<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always received reasonably good service here, no complaints to make.<br&gt;<br&gt;I rarely order dessert because I&amp;#39;m already bursting at the seams and holding a to-go box by the time I&amp;#39;m finished with My meal.

And they were great the next day.<br&gt;<br&gt;And we can&amp;#39;t leave without having some dessert. I got the oreo cheesecake, and the boys shared something with a lot of chocolate on it. And the waitstaff sang happy birthday to me. I can tell that aside from our server, who was GREAT and AWESOME, the other 2 staff members were not too excited about singing me my birthday song. They sang with minimal expression on their face and left immediately after the last note. Well.... I was not expecting it, so I was not too disappointed by it either. :) Our server was great though.

She told us about their new daily lunch specials, not, the average price was $15 - HUH? \u00a0$15 and up for a special? \u00a0Anyway, I went right into ordering our favorite appetizer, their Crispy Crab Wontons, plus waters, and a Stella Artois draft. The waters came. The crab wontons came. My Stella? Apparently there was an issue with the tap, as our server stated. After a 10+ minute delay, I stopped our server and started asking for a different beer when a manager came over with my Stella in hand, apologizing for the delay. No harm, no foul, as it was a cold Stella draft. Crisis diverted. Now it was time to order our meals. My wife opted for their Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club and I the Chargrilled Coulotte Steak which is a fancy way to say sirloin steak, medium-rare, no fries, rather spinach. The server repeated the order, shifted to walk away, then turned back and said, &amp;#34;medium on the steak?&amp;#34;; I quickly replied, &amp;#34;NO, medium-rare&amp;#34;. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Crispy Crab Wontons were excellent as always. My wife&amp;#39;s Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club came, and then a 2 minute delay then my sirloin steak arrived. As soon as the server placed my steak plate in-front of me I was concerned as my steak looked over cooked, well charred in-fact. The server didn&amp;#39;t ask me to cut into it, nor waited, she was off - note, it was lunch and they were getting busier by the minute. I immediately cut into the &amp;#34;medium-well, to well done&amp;#34; cooked steak. Looked at my wife and sighed. I got up, found the server and explained the issue. She took the crispy critter away. A few moments past, and a different manager came over to apologize again, this time for the steak, he would make everything right, yada-yada. Typical manager spiel. OK. Fine. <br&gt;<br&gt;My wife, a slow eater (true honey), was done with half of her massively huge, incredibly tasty sandwich and would be taking the other half home. Me? The spinach was excellent and I gobbled it up. Steak? \u00a0What steak. My steak never came and we were at the hour-twenty mark. I was done. I had enough fun for the day. This wasn&amp;#39;t going to happen for me. I got up, found our server and said, &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m done. The steak never came. She looked shocked and gasped &amp;#34;what?&amp;#34; I stated, &amp;#34;never came, I want the check. OK?&amp;#34; She apologized, removed the $18 steak off our bill and handed me the check. I paid the $36 balance and that was that. What&amp;#39;s curious, no other manager came to our table. After the hour mark they definitely should of showed up with more spiel but nothing.

We are seated by 1:12 pm. I order the white chicken chili. It&amp;#39;s a meal I&amp;#39;ve had before at the Cheesecake Factory and like the name states it is supposed to be a white chili, which is a basic (not acidic) dish. What comes out is a tomato-based acidic chili with a few white beans tossed in. When I informed the waitress of the significant difference between the first time I had ordered the same dish and the current time, it was offered to replace the dish. Who I can only assume was the supervisor came over, introductions were not made, and when it was explained that due to reflux I was not able to eat the acidic dish which had, in previous experience, been basic and was described as and commonly is basic, it was stated by the supervisor that it is a white chicken chili because there are white beans in it, though she seconded the offer to replace the meal. No additional requests had been made after the initial offer and acceptance by myself or the rest of my party. I ordered the Factory Meatloaf instead. It was then 1:43pm. \u00a0At 2:20pm, the meatloaf dish arrived, my party long since finished eating. It initially looked fine, but due to the previous issue and the long wait time for what is typically a pre-prepared and simple dish, I took a closer look at meal, particularly the meat which was covered in onions and gravy, which was not unexpected. Upon review, the bottom of the first piece was burnt black on the edges encroaching toward the middle, but, after waiting so long, I wasn&amp;#39;t inclined to send it back or complain for what was still largely an edible dish. I checked the second piece, and the entire bottom was blackened to the point that my fork could not pierce it. Over an hour had been spent waiting for food, and without a desire to wait another 40 minutes for a meal and have my party wait further, \u00a0and with the lack of desire to trust a request for a third meal without tampering, we opted to leave, a second chance already having been given. The item itself was removed from the bill, but no offer of recompense was made for the wasted time or for the poor experience, including lack of offer for the bill itself being cleared (party having only consisted of myself and one other). These days it seems like quality of service is in decline and you are only offered compensation if a scene is made. Decorum and fair exchange of goods is a thing of the past, as certainly my and my parties time and experience did not equate to the monetary value required in relation to the services and goods received. At this time, I do not intend to return to this location of The Cheesecake Factory. The waitresses service was adequate, and she was still tipped, as she did not do any wrongdoing herself and therefore should not pay for the poor experience. My problem is with the establishment itself and with the quality of the food, the chefs, the length of time for service in receipt of the food, and the amelioration of the situation. Certainly, if the food had not been burnt and overcooked, it would have arrived quicker, killing two birds with one stone. Over an hour passed, an hour wasted, and I&amp;#39;m left to seek another establishment for nourishment.
