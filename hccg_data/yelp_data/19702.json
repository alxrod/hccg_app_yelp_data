However, service needs to be addressed. First off, while waiting for our food, we hear the manager yell at an employee in front of everyone. This is just poor management. Issues with employees need to be addressed in private. <br&gt;Kimberly P. was our server and just sucked as a waitress. First off, my husband sat down while I was in the restroom. When I came out of the restroom, Kimberly saw me sit down and open up the menu, as she was facing our table near the register. I hadn&amp;#39;t even had literally 1 minute to look at the menu, when she asked if we were ready to order. I looked up at her, and told her that I hadn&amp;#39;t had a chance to look at the menu yet. Afterwards, I decided what I wanted and closed my menu. She walked past our table multiple times making eye contact with me, but not stopping to ask if we were ready to order yet. I felt like she was punishing me for not ordering when she asked me initially. Then my husband and I both ordered the Gluten free farfalle. The menu doesn&amp;#39;t tell you that you get rotini noodles with all of their GF pasta dishes, so I found that out when my food was brought to the table and was a bit disappointed. She brought me my GF pasta but brought my husband regular pasta. Although I am the only one with Celiac disease, my husband often orders GF for support. We said nothing about it and he ate it. Generally we wouldn&amp;#39;t blame the waitress for this error, but rather the cook. However, that is how she rang the order in. Still yet, no harm no foul. Her incompetence as a waitress came in mainly when she brought the check. She decided to drop it off after we finished our meal. She hadn&amp;#39;t asked us if we wanted dessert, but we requested it. While waiting for our dessert, she attempted to take our check twice. My husband had not yet put his credit card up. So on the second attempt, he reached into his pocket and pulled out his credit card so that she could run the card; she was obviously in a hurry. Dessert came and while we were still eating, she tried to take the signature ticket. My husband put his hand on it and said, &amp;#34;That part&amp;#39;s not done yet&amp;#34;. I mean, dropping the check off early is fine. But trying to pick up the signature page while we&amp;#39;re still eating is bad taste. All she wanted to do was see what her tip was going to be. There was no other reason to come after the ticket booklet at that point. Our credit card was already ran, so the food had been paid for long before we even got dessert. Needless to say, she ruined any chance of a tip at that point.

My first impression was when a hostess ran into my sister who was sitting down. Accidents happen but what irritated me was the lack of manners. She was completely unapologetic. I was stunned at first but quickly turned into laughter when the hostess turned around to shoot daggers at her. \u00a0As if to insinuate, she (the hostess) was entitled to some apology from my sister (the customer). We should have left then, instead we chased our losses. After waiting an hour for a table, we thought maybe the food will be worth it. It wasn&amp;#39;t. I ordered the bacon burger and my sister ordered the bbq burger. The waitress asked how we would like them cooked. We both said well done. Our burgers came out to us about 45mins later. I was starving at this point and couldn&amp;#39;t wait to dig in. I sinked my teeth into a large mouth watering bite. I almost puked. It was like sucking on pennies. The meat was raw. The burger was literally dripping out of my hands and onto the plate. My sister cut her burger in half. Same deal, raw meat. We wanted to leave. Of course we wouldn&amp;#39;t see the waitress again for a another 20mins. When she swung by to ask how everything was, we told her the burgers are not cooked. What she said next compelled me to write this review. I don&amp;#39;t write reviews often. Usually it&amp;#39;s only when I receive exceptional service. However, her response to &amp;#34;the burgers are not cooked&amp;#34; was so astonishing, it deserved to be documented. As she leaned over the table to gaze at the pink goo dripping out the bun, she said &amp;#34;Yea, I see. So do you want to take them home?&amp;#34;. WTF?! For what, as pets? We emphatically said no can we please have the check. She disappeared for a moment then returns to ask us if we&amp;#39;re staying for dessert. It would have been funny if we didn&amp;#39;t just waste 2 hours and were still very hungry. We said no, we just want to leave.
