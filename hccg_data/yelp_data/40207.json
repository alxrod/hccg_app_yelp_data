I sat at the bar to order their seasonal cheesecake Peppermint Bark. Rather, I ordered the Coffee &amp;amp; Cream Chocolate Supreme, as I was motioned by someone that the Peppermint Bark wasn&amp;#39;t good. Also, I asked the bartender about this cheesecake and his answer was all over the place. Therefore, I concluded it hasn&amp;#39;t consistently received good feedback. Their cheesecake isn&amp;#39;t cheap and I like to be pretty certain. Well....I ended up not liking the Coffee &amp;amp; Cream cheesecake. I ate it all, as it wasn&amp;#39;t horrible, but I won&amp;#39;t order again. I have a few winning favorites, but my all time go-to is the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut (so delicious!). You can always rely on their cheesecake presentation being on point. I sometimes hate sticking in the fork the first time, but once I do and take that first bite it&amp;#39;s all over.<br&gt;<br&gt;Just a few extra notes I&amp;#39;ve noticed to be repeats - parking usually requires much \u00a0patience unless you valet and the service (bar and dining) are pretty decent.", "rating": 3, "date": "1/5/2019"}, {"text": "The last time I had been to the Cheesecake Factory was high school.

My eggs were repulsive. They were pouched horribly. And both my lady&amp;#39;s&amp;#39; and my own chicken was also just plain disgusting.

I never ordered coffee, but maybe they bring you some then?<br&gt;<br&gt;Ok, I digress. \u00a0We all ordered something different and I will say, despite service being friendly, and them refilling our ginormous drinks promptly whenever we drank 1/2 the glass, no matter what we ordered, the food took FOREVER. \u00a0We were later told that Well Done burgers take a minimum of 20 minutes to cook. \u00a0Odd.. but... ok... \u00a0Since a number of us ordered burgers, we were the hold up? \u00a0Also, true to form, everyone at the table was served, except for my husband, despite him ordering what was arguably the simplest thing at the table... We&amp;#39;re not sure why, but this happens to him... a lot! \u00a0And, once his food DID arrive they brought it out in stages... which consequently meant he got an extra side dish... \u00a0I guess that made up for him having to watch us all eat for 5 minutes?<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered a Mac &amp;amp; Cheese Burger because I&amp;#39;d had one at a posh joint in Denver and was pretty disappointed. \u00a0I was curious if a chain like The Cheesecake Factory could improve on it, and do it cheaper... and boy, did they! \u00a0It was arguably the cheesiest burger I&amp;#39;ve ever had. \u00a0I had subbed in a side of Sweet Potato Fries and those were excellent as well. \u00a0A friend of ours at the table had never had Sweet Potato fries and I guess the ones at Cheesecake Factory made him a believer, because he&amp;#39;s ordering them everywhere now!<br&gt;<br&gt;Everyone seemed to enjoy their choices and we were all stuffed... which was kind of a bummer...

I like having good food. <br&gt;<br&gt;We started with appetizers and were considering how expensive everything is. Should be good right? For what I&amp;#39;m paying for? Quality and tasty food? It let me down. I had a great time here because I came with fantastic company. But the grub was not up to standard. I can make a much better meal from pantry items on the fly.<br&gt;<br&gt;We started with stuffed mushrooms, and the firecracker salmon. The stuffed mushrooms were decent. No real complaint there I suppose. A bit greasy but tasty nonetheless. Now the firecracker salmon was another story. I have to show you and let you decide. Considering what we expected versus what we received... it was a strong fail. Just by the looks of it. Greasy, disproportional portions and oh so sloppy. I thought our waitress just didn&amp;#39;t carry it over straight, so the dish just slid to one side.<br&gt;<br&gt;Then there was the chicken pasta da Vinci. It was just plain pasta noodles with some mushrooms and some chicken. Now this is where I swear I can do better with pantry items. One box of pasta cooked al dente. One can of campbells cream of mushroom and a half can of water. Some fresh whole mushrooms sliced up and saut\u00e9ed in butter and a bit of salt... And some chicken. Any chicken. Even canned chunk chicken drained and rinsed. Cook it up and serve it. It would be more flavorful than this pasta dish at Cheesecake Factory, and less greasy. It just wasn&amp;#39;t very flavorful. And the amount of chicken and mushrooms in my dish was pitiful.<br&gt;<br&gt;For the price, it could&amp;#39;ve had a garden salad or something thrown in. I feel like I ate unhealthy food, and yet it wasn&amp;#39;t rewarding... like a dirty food truck taco would&amp;#39;ve been a better way to go than this faux fancy place. <br&gt;<br&gt;There are so many restaurateurs in Louisville at a similar price point.

Each year when I take the kids, I make sure to go during a non-peak time. I know the waiters and waitresses work hard for those really big tips off the typical really big bills. Probably lots of folks take advantage of the more affordable cheesecake deal and do what we did. Every year the servers have always been so nice and accommodating. They told us the wait would be 15 to 20 minutes, but we got our table for 7 in about 10 minutes. Long enough for the kids to catch some Pokemon in the lobby. <br&gt;<br&gt;We had an amazing waitress. She wasn&amp;#39;t upset that we only ordered waters to drink. When we sat down I told her we were going to get a few appetizers and then enjoy some of the cheesecake. She seemed happy to serve us. We ordered two pizzas to share. Each pizza had 8 reasonably size slices. She also was quick to refill our drinks and the bread on the table. <br&gt;<br&gt;She checked on us several times, never making us feel rushed, just being attended to. When the cheesecake came out the kids eyes grew large and their mouths nearly dropped to the table. They&amp;#39;d never seen pieces of cheesecake so big. Having some older kiddos with me, I asked if we could get five coffees. She was quick to bring them along with creamer. The kids, many of them having never been to a &amp;#34;fancy restaurant&amp;#34; before were thoroughly impressed with the real creamer.<br&gt;<br&gt;When the check came it was just under $60 for 2 pizzas and 7 slices of cheesecake.

Dinner portions are huge. You pay for the size though and I wouldn&amp;#39;t call it gourmet.

The fish tacos I had were dry and bland, the chicken pasta my aunt had was swimming in olive oil.<br&gt;<br&gt;The thing about it is you don&amp;#39;t come here for dinner, you truly come for dessert.

Potstickers were okay but not great. The soy sauce was a bit salty for my taste. An arugula salad with raisons, nuts and slivers of parmesan in a lemon olive oil dressing was light and delish.

The Cheesecake Factory stomped all over these places and regurgitated them out in a spewing barrage of fire next to a Victoria&amp;#39;s Secret. Plus, cheesecake. <br&gt;<br&gt;Before moving to Louisville, I had never been to one of these places. After the moving truck had left and I was sobbing amidst 89546 boxes my husband looked at me and said HEY, YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TO A CHEESECAKE FACTORY LET&amp;#39;S GO TO THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. This from a man who is a regular at Viajante on Picadilly Square. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ummm, parking is never an issue at TCF. It&amp;#39;s got mall parking, plus,valet. The restaurant, Awww shit, we can&amp;#39;t even call it a restaurant... It&amp;#39;s like a COMPOUND. the compound seats roughly the size of a small country. If the people of Monaco ever decided to go out to eat together they could probably fit in TCF. It&amp;#39;s a clean place, with a sort of vaguely Mediterranean feel, and has lots of glass art sort of junk all over. They have GIANT booths that seat like twenty people. <br&gt;<br&gt;The menu weighs roughly the size of a teenager. BUT THEY SERVE BOOZE, and they have about 100 different wines. The cocktails are pretty boozy too, and big, Both the Mojito and Lemon Drop I&amp;#39;ve had were actually quite good. And onto the food...<br&gt;<br&gt;I hate recommending TCF. There are hundreds of independently owned restaurants where you can get a better meal for cheaper. everything at TCF is the WORST part of Amerikkkkka, gigantic portions, sugar in EVERYTHING, \u00a0TCF is why you&amp;#39;re fat, but..but...but..<br&gt;<br&gt;The food is pretty good. It&amp;#39;s not exactly innovative or exciting but it&amp;#39;s good. After eating there I actually read a few articles about TCF to like, make myself feel better about not hating it. It turns out TCF is hugely popular with pro athletes due to the portion sizes. NPR had a segment about trying to disparage the food served there and despite terrifying calorie counts they just couldn&amp;#39;t. It&amp;#39;s consistently voted one if the best &amp;#34; chain restaurants&amp;#34; and it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to see why. Stand outs for me include The Vietnamese tacos with Asian pork and lots of fresh cilantro, The spicy cashew chicken, and the Chicken and biscuits, which is perfect, trashy, buttery food coma goodness. They also carry something called a &amp;#34; glamburger&amp;#34; which I have never tried, but I like to imagine it&amp;#39;s a hamburger covered in glitter and rhinestones. the worst part of the meals are the actual cheesecakes, they are just gooey globs of very mild cheesecake usually covered in syrups or stuffed with drugstore candy. <br&gt;<br&gt;You sort of have to at least try TCF. It&amp;#39;s like Disneyworld. You go, you see what all the fuss is about, you never have to go again.

Five minutes later, our server came to check on us and started to correct our order, That whole process took another ten minutes. The blackened chicken came in two minutes while the sweet potato fries came five minutes after that. So, either the chicken was sitting under a heat lamp the entire time, or it was sitting on another table where someone else touched it and took it apart to realize they had the wrong sandwich.
