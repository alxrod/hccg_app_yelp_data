I am a fan favorite of the Cheesecake Factory however, after two failed attempts at takeout, I had to vent. I work downtown and grabbing a salad \u00a0is my go to. The first time I placed an order for their Cobb, I was shocked; there was primarily lettuce and only minimal on the toppings. I&amp;#39;ve had the salads many of times dining in and it&amp;#39;s always plentiful.<br&gt;<br&gt;Last week, I ordered the Chinese chicken salad and when I opened the container, there were the crispy white noodle (sorry not sure what the name is); chicken looking like it had been sitting and ... a ton of lettuce. There was only one dressing and there should have been two. It was the driest, most disappointing salad. After a few bites, I threw it away. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve decided not to order out again and when it reopens, after some time, will dine in. It&amp;#39;s two disappointing times and it seems the quality is very different when you pick up/ take out vs. dine in. <br&gt;<br&gt;Outside of that, the staff there are very nice and professional!", "rating": 2, "date": "4/27/2020"}, {"text": "This location has been here for years!

Which is is why I felt more a reason to write my review of how disappointed I am. I&amp;#39;ve celebrated a few celebrations here, with huge amounts of people in the party, and this by far was thee worst! <br&gt;<br&gt;We had our company &amp;#34;Bringing in the New Year&amp;#34; dinner last night. Mind you its was a party of 20. Reservations were made for 7pm, so its not like they weren&amp;#39;t aware. Let&amp;#39;s start off that we had one server for the whole party. She did the best that she could, with only serving us all by herself. So no complaints with our server. It did take 25 mins to get our drinks. After eating baskets of bread, you can imagine how parched we all were, frustrated that we didnt even have water to wash it all down. Finally our drinks came out, but haven&amp;#39;t been asked yet if appetizers were wanted. It took another 20mins for the appetizers to come out. Yes! We were all happy to have a little something to hold us until our entrees. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now this is when the whole entire table started to get irritated and pissed at this point. Half of us were starting to fall asleep! It took AN HOUR! One whole hour to get our food! What&amp;#39;s more sad is that we all literally took a few bites and one by one we were all asking for box to take our food home. \u00a0We all ordered a cheesecake as well, and the server even knew to just pack them all to go. We didnt get out until 10pm. We spent most of our time waiting. Let&amp;#39;s just say the doctors and boss will not be booking our next company dinner here. We were all so disappointed.", "rating": 2, "date": "1/5/2020"}, {"text": "Consistently delicious! Our server was super helpful and had great recommendations.

Today, I feel as though I solved the frightening large menu conundrum.<br&gt;<br&gt;Firstly, we waited about 15 minutes for a table for two. Which made sense as it was 5pm on a Sunday right after a matinee at the Smith center had finished. The three ladies at the hostess station were rockin getting people seated in an efficient manner. Now, one is never mad when they have to wait because now you just stare and find the cheesecake of your dreams for dessert.<br&gt;<br&gt;Once we were seated our waiter Ruben came by! He brought us our waters and could tell we weren&amp;#39;t ready with our order just yet. We just couldn&amp;#39;t decide what to order and instead ordered four different small bites/appetizers and got to have a little bit of everything. We had the fried zucchini, fried crab bites, roadside sliders and the potstickers. We just shared them and got to eat a bit of everything! For dessert we of course got cheesecake - I had the cookie dough cheesecake and he had the Reese&amp;#39;s cheesecake! Of course, we did have to take half of those home because we were stuffed.", "rating": 4, "date": "8/5/2019"}, {"text": "With guilty pleasures of all forms prevalent in Las Vegas, my personal guilty pleasure is food -- and the chain restaurant of the Cheesecake Factory, as I mentioned in a previous review from another Favtory location! Infamous for being one of the most ridiculously unhealthy restaurants in the States ( with many of its foods clocking in at over 2000 calories by themselves, and that&amp;#39;s not including the cheesecakes they&amp;#39;re famous for! ), I still enjoy it enough that it&amp;#39;s worth the calorie binge just to indulge in cheesecake.<br&gt;<br&gt;As I was in the area for a work-related function, I stopped into the Factory location at the Outlet Shopping Center for lunch -- which was just as well, since I managed to get seated before the lunch rush arrived! As for the food, I ordered the fried macaroni and cheese, the soup of the day, the Factory combo of chicken Madeira and steak Diane, and the mango and key lime cheesecake.<br&gt;<br&gt;Per the usual, the Cheesecake Factory provides complementary bread for one to munch on while waiting for the food, and it is quite tasty, though I admit I didn&amp;#39;t eat too much of the bread as I intended to save room for my order. The fried macaroni and cheese was the first to come out, and it was crisp, flavorful and indulgent! Perfectly gooey, as well -- as macaroni and cheese should be!<br&gt;<br&gt;With regards to the soup of the day, I was told it was a chicken and vegetable soup. However, it came out with tortilla strips, so it was chicken tortilla, and then I found potatoes and rice in it, which is... not typical of tortilla soup? I will admit, I tried to like it, but I was left more confused about what kind of soup it was. It was not to my liking, to put it mildly.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Factory combo I ordered had one of my personal favorite items on the menu -- the steak Diane -- so of course I enjoyed it immensely, but the chicken Madeira was also very good and surprisingly light despite mozzarella cheese being among the chief ingredients of the dish. I polished as much of the plate as I could, though I didn&amp;#39;t finish the potatoes since I wanted to save enough room for dessert.<br&gt;<br&gt;Of the numerous cheesecakes on offer, this time I went for the mango key lime cheesecake for something different and more tart than the usual. The acidity of the lime and the sweetness of the mango -- plus the surprise coconut macaroon crust really made this a spectacular and somewhat lighter option of all the cheesecakes on offer. Props to my server for recommending it!<br&gt;<br&gt;The Cheesecake Factory is popular enough here in Vegas that it has multiple outposts in the City. However, one of the things I noticed is that it took a while for my server to get back to me with my orders -- which, while understandable during the latter part of the meal due to more diners coming in, it was noticeable early on when there wasn&amp;#39;t that many people in the restaurant that they were really slow. That plus the miss on the soup of the day means that this location only gets three out of five stars for me.

We ordered calamari, Chicken Romano, Filet subbed mashed potatoes with saut\u00e9ed spinach, chocolate cake, and a Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake.<br&gt;<br&gt;They can&amp;#39;t even slice the calamari before frying them. I had a whole squid mixed in with tentacles and rings. The noodles that came with the chicken Romano was not al dente - it was undercooked and chewy. I had to take it home and pour 1/4 cup of boiling water to bring the noodles to life. My sister got the filet and instead of mashed potatoes, she asked for saut\u00e9ed spinach. She got about 8 leaves of uncooked spinach and the plating was just plain horrible. The chocolate cake and the cheesecake were good. However, they&amp;#39;re 3/4 the size of what you&amp;#39;d normally get at other locations. For the same price, you get less food and poor quality.<br&gt;<br&gt;Service was just as bad. It was slow.

We went because we had a gift card. Even though the last few times (at other locations), the experience has been similar. Our server was slow, completely uninterested and lackadaisical. It started out semi fine, but turned into sitting and waiting for forever for everything with empty drinks.

But he was no where to be found. <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered the tuna poke entree. The presentation was beautiful as always. But the rice was dry (and wayyyyy too much of it), there was verryyyyyy little siracha aioli, and it was really bland over all. To give an example how bland- I shared it with my 9 month old baby. Especially for $15.95. I could get a delicious sushi burrito bowl with good quality fish and amazing toppings and fresh rice for $9 at a lot of places in Vegas now!<br&gt;<br&gt;We also ordered the Shrimp with angel hair which was good and pasta cooked well and the crispy chicken costoletta.

I finally arrived and spoke with the manager in which he did apologize and said we would be seated in 30 minutes.

Cold dismissiveness. I thank her for taking my money, but she continues to stand there. My cheesecake? No. She eyeballs the guy standing beside me, then back at me.

I had a bunch of questions about the menu, since it&amp;#39;d been a while. I opted for the lunch size asian salad, while hubby had his favorite item, the cuban sandwich, and our little man had the mini corndogs and fries. It was delicious. I couldn&amp;#39;t finish my salad, which was pretty big, even for the lunch size, but I&amp;#39;m glad I asked about the size of the salad. We also got dessert, once I mentioned the crazy one, hubby wanted that one. It was really good, too. I just was stuffed. (We had leftovers.) We still had a balance on one of the gift cards. They are treated as credit cards, so you still have to sign them. <br&gt;<br&gt;The service was excellent- our server was pretty attentive (drink refills, and checking on us from time to time).

We had to switch seats (booth &amp;amp; tables seating is available) as the TV had hubby&amp;#39;s game that he was DVR&amp;#39;ing. Our stoller was stored with the rest, elsewhere. The lady gave us a claim ticket. <br&gt;<br&gt;Bathrooms were near the entrance. There were mens, womens, and a family one. I went into the womens and there were two stalls, one was handicapped. I went into the smaller one so I don&amp;#39;t know if there was a baby changing station in the handicapped stall. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food court at this Premium Outlets is really lacking (Ok, who am I kidding, it sucks!), so this restaurant is going to be very busy and popular (the huge menu and the huge selection of cheesecake flavors).

I ordered a slice of the Banana Creme Cheesecake. They brought our cheesecakes, and I took one bite of mine and it was FROZEN. At that point, I was so over it I didn&amp;#39;t even want to mention it to the waitress, but the rest of my party was fed up and told her as soon as she came over again. She made a face and informed us that the Cheesecakes are all freshly made.<br&gt;<br&gt;I poked the cheesecake with my fork to demonstrate and it made the classic &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; sound of a frozen cake, so she took away my cheesecake and was gone for another 10 minutes (this was the trend of the whole meal). When she returned, she asked if I&amp;#39;d like to have strawberry cheesecake instead. I said no thank you, can I please just have another slice of the banana creme? She then informed me that the banana creme was all frozen. So I ended up with no cheesecake.<br&gt;<br&gt;And all would have been well if that had been the end of it. I&amp;#39;d have left sad and disappointed, but not angry. No, the anger came when I got the bill and saw that my frozen, inedible, cheesecake that I had been forced to cancel was charged on the bill, and then marked as a &amp;#34;comp.&amp;#34; Being forced to take back food because it is frozen is not a &amp;#34;comp, &amp;#34; that is bad customer service. It is insulting to your customers when you mark food as a &amp;#34;comp&amp;#34; when in fact they received nothing. I had one bite of frozen cake and was forced to send it back. You have not done me any favors by not charging me for that cake. That cake should never have been given to me in the first place. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, the main dishes we did receive were the usual yummy quality of Cheesecake Factory.

This review is specifically aimed for this location. \u00a0This was my first time to this property. I came tonight for a birthday party. Now I understand large groups can be challenging but with that being said there were still some awkward moments. I arrived and when I asked for my party the girl at the front just gave me half ass directions. She told me to go through the double doors. The only double doors I saw looked like an exit outside so I just kind of roamed around aimlessly until I was able to stop and ask another employee where to go. So those double doors that led out were correct. So they have doors that go outside first and then there is another set of doors leading to a separate room. But come on.... I know I couldn&amp;#39;t have been the first person to be confused by the layout. It wouldn&amp;#39;t have killed her to give a little more detail. Our server was nice and personable. I ordered the Louisiana pasta. Tasty but not really memorable. The lady next to me ordered the salmon which she said was fantastic. Two people on opposite ends of the table ordered the shrimp angel hair pasta and they both said the shrimp was WAY over cooked, rubbery and a lot of shell. See no one really checked on how the meal was until we were all almost done. Since it was a birthday my friend was trying to be discreet and let the server know about the dissatisfaction with the shrimp on two dishes. His response was that she should have let him no sooner. And yes... she should have. But no one came by to check. So was she supposed to interrupt dinner to find someone. Again, it was a birthday party and she didn&amp;#39;t want to make a scene. Then the check came without offering anyone dessert. Yes.... dessert came for the birthday girl. So that should have been a great time to ask anyone if they would like to finish it off with something sweet. When my check was handed to me I asked for a piece to go and was told I would have to have two separate checks. Ok fine. I guess it&amp;#39;s somehow my fault I wasn&amp;#39;t offered dessert before the check. 2 bills then. Whatever.

My wife and I were contemplating on exchanging it for equal slices since they were the same price at $7.95. We arrive back at the cheesecake factory with only 5 to 10 minutes passing by since us leaving. I did not wan&amp;#39;t to deal with the rude employee so I approached a manager and he had asked if everything was fine. I explained I wanted to exchange the slice for a bigger portion since they were the same price. Get our moneys worth you know... Sam the manager said once a slice leaves the place they can&amp;#39;t exchange it but he could give a discount at 25% if we would like to purchase a bigger piece. I agreed and had already pulled my debit card and he noticed my military ID thanking me for my service. I said thank you also. At the sometime the disgruntle employee is nodding her head in disgust as if we were trying to get a free slice. I couldn&amp;#39;t hold my tongue anymore and said this is what I had to deal with earlier. Pointed to her and told him she is rude. He said don&amp;#39;t worry I will take care of you and you can pick a slice and we will cover it. Let me explain I did not want anything free but I called my wife over and she picked out an oreo cheesecake slice. The employee had to cut the free slice for us but was still shaking her head. This made me more furious and I started to raise my voice. During all this commotion the employee was still nodding her head the whole time I was talking to Sam. There was at least 4 separate instances she did it. Sam said he would take care of her later. He also explained he would take care of us the next time we came in. He asked if we were locals. I said yes I have been stationed at Nellis, AFB more than 11 years. I still left pissed off. I don&amp;#39;t care about the free slice. I would have paid for better customer service.

Dessert was the only thumbs up we gave for the night, but even dessert couldn&amp;#39;t stop us from wanting to run out of there!

We sat next to the kitchen and the salad was sitting for some time. By the time the dishes came the buffalo blast were over fried as if the grease was old. \u00a0So the server took it back. Within 2 minutes they brought out the same blast that I just sent back. When they finally brought the blast out they looked the same. \u00a0If anyone has ever had an order of buffalo blast they are very light with a hint of chicken and a blast sauce inside. \u00a0So of course I didn&amp;#39;t want them 20 minutes later. \u00a0The bun on the bacon burger was hard as if it was stale. The bacon burger had 2 strips of regular bacon and literally 2 small squares of applewood bacon ;(. When the waiter brought out the check he took off the order for the blast but added an order of buffalo wings that no one ordered. \u00a0The only thing that was worth the trip was the bread and butter. Of course the check was adjusted but we were really disappointed with the Cheesecake Factory. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;Thank goodness for Winchells being open 24 hours.

The other 10,000 parking spaces are located elsewhere and lead directly into the mall. \u00a0But the back door to the Cheesecake factory is closer to the actual mall and much more convenient for people to enter and leave the restaurant. \u00a0Half the seating in this location is located in the row going from the check-in to the back door. \u00a0And this is the only seating where they allow children. \u00a0So as your eating you literally have 100&amp;#39;s of people walking back and forth past your table to enter and leave the restaurant. \u00a0No one uses the front door since it leads out to the street and the mall is the other direction. \u00a0Now add a stroller with a sleeping baby in it. \u00a0We usually ask for a table away from others so our child is not a distraction. \u00a0We know what it was like before we had a child. \u00a0But this place was packed and we had to take the only available table which was a booth. \u00a0So we placed the stroller plush against the front of the booth since our child was asleep. \u00a0But now with 100s of people coming in and out the back door we closed traffic to one way since the stroller was there. \u00a0Now the manager noticed the interruption of bodies moving because of the stroller and was about to ask us to move it down the hall when he realized our son was asleep in it. \u00a0So I asked him to make the back door an exit only like most businesses. \u00a0And he tried explaining it is a fire hazard which is not true. \u00a0it is only a fire hazard if it is locked and you can not get out. \u00a0So this meal was certainly not relaxing and not enjoyable. \u00a0Trying to make sure people do not run into the stroller and eat at the same time is not fun. \u00a0They are more worried about losing customers because they cant actually find the front door to this location than making the people their comfortable. \u00a0And if they had told us from the get go their was no place to sit with a stroller we would have gone somewhere else.

I told him that I would need some ketchup to put on my hamburger and at least 15 minutes passed until he came back with the ketchup and at which time he said... I&amp;#39;ll get those sweet potato fries ordered for you. I told him to forget it as it was too late. We were already done eating and were ready to leave.

They were all good. The teriyaki chicken was a bit dry and needed a little bit more favor added to it, the pineapple that came with the chicken was super sour so wasnt touched after I tried it, the mini corndog meal for the kids were just three little things on a stick with a tiny bowl of fruit and that was gone in no time and the kid was still hungry. (News flash some kids eat more then others.. the kids menu goes from I wanna say 4 to 10 years old.. but that is too little for a 9 year old.. come on). The service could have been a little better we were sitting there a good 20 minutes before we could even get dessert. The kids hot fudge sundae was just two tiny ( barely there )scoops of icecream with a little bit of chocolate chips, and fudge on it and cost $3.50 ( again some kids can eat more).

And being Vegas locals why not go to the new one so that we can shop at the outlets right after. Lets start off by saying I&amp;#39;m 9 months pregnant so waiting for food for too long is not my best friend. We came in and it took a second to be greeted by the host because she found whatever she was doing to be more important. After she was done she did greet us and we waited to be seated. Our host came and showed us to our seat and said our waiter would be with us shortly. So to kill time we started talking until we noticed it had been 5 min already and no one has acknowledged us yet , but we saw plenty servers walking by. My patience started wearing thin as an additional 10 minz had went by and weren&amp;#39;t offered so much as a hello, a drink, NOTHING. so I finally asked a girl if I can speak with the manager and instead of going to get he or she, she replied &amp;#34;oh I&amp;#39;m your server give me a minute they seated three of y&amp;#39;all at once&amp;#34;. First that&amp;#39;s very unprofessional, second don&amp;#39;t think that because we&amp;#39;re both African american that I&amp;#39;ll just be ok with that and let you talk to me the way you feel comfortable, and third if you were so busy its not that hard to COMMUNICATE that with your guests. So of course I took my business elsewhere so thanks a lot for wasting my time that I can never get back and ruining my birthday and I will be sure to yelp you folks as well.
