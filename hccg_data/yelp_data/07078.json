It&amp;#39;s 8:00pm and the mall is closing in an hour. <br&gt;2. As our buzzer went off and we get up to be seated at our table, in walks a man with a little chihuahua on a leash. All of our mouths dropped. One lady with a family of 5 asked the hostess if dogs were allowed in the restaurant. The server said, only service dogs. The lady exclaimed, &amp;#34;that was not a service dog &amp;amp; he was not blind&amp;#34;. The hostess just shrugged her shoulders. The lady and her whole family canceled their reservation &amp;amp; walked out exclaiming how unsanitary it was. I totally agreed.

Our table didn&amp;#39;t have enough silverware, it took forever to get our bread and some of us got drinks while others didn&amp;#39;t. I was with a party of four.

We were disgusted and informed the waitress. She took the plate, came back &amp;amp; stayed she took it off the bill, but the manager argued with her that the hair didn&amp;#39;t belong to any of the cooks because they were all men.

Failed to make the famous Evelyn pasta THREE TIMES (literally made it 3 times over and NOT ONE VERSION was the &amp;#34;Evelyn&amp;#34; pasta we eat at 6 other cheesecake locations across the country). Every version came out of the kitchen with the chef&amp;#39;s very own twist (also VERY ODD for a FRANCHISE) rather than the menu description and with a heavy, heavy hand of salt and oregano (EWw). Chicken Madeira tasted like it was doused with kerosene and also needed to be remade. The famous make your own Thai chicken lettuce wraps came already made for us as tacos rolled in hot, soft, wilted lettuce (this is not the way Cheesecake factory serves this dish and also a HEALTH HAZARD). After complaining to the waiter several times and talking to the manager several times, the waiter continues to come over and ask us time after time and says, &amp;#34;So..UM...what&amp;#39;s wrong?&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;So...what&amp;#39;s going on guys?&amp;#34; IT WAS LIKE THE TWILIGHT ZONE. When we discussed all these issues with the manager never once an apology, he just says to us: &amp;#34;Ohhhhhhh.............thank you.&amp;#34; - and walks away - WHAT?!?! crazy!!!!! So, can we give this place zero stars? Finally the manager&amp;#39;s manager who seemed *slightly* more aware of the issues came over to say hello, although she was very sweet, needs a VERY big lesson on customer service and hospitality, I mean, she acted like what she did by removing 1 appetizer from our bill, maybe a damn slice of cheesecake after all of these issues would have been nice????? The cherry on top of our imaginary cheesecake was when we asked one of your employees to kindly watch us (2 females) walk out to the car as it was very late at night and dark out, he comes outside with us, waves, enthusiastically, &amp;#34;Good night ladies!!!!!&amp;#34; and goes RIGHT BACK INSIDE !!!

As with every other Cheesecake Factory, this place was packed. The hostess told us it would be about a half hour wait. We put our names down, grabbed a buzzer, and plopped down in the waiting area. 15 minutes later, I felt a buzz, buzz, buzz in my back pocket, we weaved our way through the herd of people waiting for a table and were ushered right to a nice intimate table for two.<br&gt; <br&gt;Both feeling healthy we decided to order off the SkinnyLicious menu and boy was it delicious. I got the Lunch Miso Salmon substituting the white rice for spinach. My fianc\u00e9 got the grilled steak medallions. Both entrees were outstanding. My salmon was packed with so much flavor. It tasted just as good as if I got it from Nobu. We also decided to split the Korean Fried Cauliflower (which was probably one of the best appetizers I had a very long time) and the Edemame.<br&gt;<br&gt;We were so full and satisfied that we couldn&amp;#39;t even order a cheesecake.

Our food was amazingly good however, I was displeased with the drinks ordered.<br&gt;<br&gt;First, I ordered a Mojito. It was completely watered down with no hint of alcohol whatsoever. So when our waiter came, I asked him to take it back and I&amp;#39;ll have a Cosmopolitan instead. Well, the Cosmo arrived and tasted just as crappy as the last disappointment. So, again, I told him that this wasn&amp;#39;t acceptable and could he just bring red wine instead. <br&gt;<br&gt;This dude decides to bring the manager on call instead. She politely came over to tell me that they&amp;#39;re not taking the second drink off the tab. I replied: &amp;#34;Well...I&amp;#39;m dissatisfied with your drink service. I ordered red wine as the absolute last resort and I doubt I&amp;#39;ll send it back - as it is wine. I mean, you can&amp;#39;t really screw up wine.&amp;#34; Annoyed, she takes my drink from the table and never says another word. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ok. Fine. No drinks. <br&gt;<br&gt;We&amp;#39;re ready for the check now. It arrives with the Cosmo on it. I gave the check back and had it removed (it took a while to come back to the table. I guess she was pissed and had to contemplate it for a while).<br&gt;<br&gt;Whatever.<br&gt;<br&gt;The bill came back correct. We paid and left.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you ever visit the cheesecake factory, get plain alcohol with NO ice or just play it safe with wine.

Two of my usuals are the Thai Lettuce Wraps (when I want something a little lighter) and the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas (those corn cakes on the side are ah-mazing). Today my boss treated the staff to lunch for Admin. Professional&amp;#39;s Day, and everyone loved their meals. We shared several appetizers: Avocado Egg Rolls (always a favorite; these are ridiculously good), Buffalo Blasts (really good; the portion is huge), the Crab &amp;amp; Artichoke Dip (okay but not great; the flavor was a little lacking), and the Fried Mac n Cheese Balls (I mean it&amp;#39;s fried mac n cheese. what&amp;#39;s not to love?) For my meal, I had the fish tacos with the tempura style fish. I&amp;#39;ve had plenty of fish tacos in my day, and these are pretty exceptional. The cabbage slaw takes it over the top with the right amount of acidity and crunch. The rice and beans on the side were better than average as well. I ordered my cheesecake to go because I was beyond stuffed at this point. I had the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake, and I&amp;#39;d definitely recommend it (as long as you&amp;#39;re not one of those if it&amp;#39;s not chocolate it&amp;#39;s not dessert kind of people).

Cheesecake factory. Ever.<br&gt;<br&gt;let me start by saying my family is big Cheesecake factory fans, but this place sucks.<br&gt;<br&gt;1) The waiter was just bad. So slow we could have cooked the food ourselves. Whenever we asked for something, like the bread which we got after the food arrived (and should we really have to ask for it at all?!), or the beer which we got after the food arrived too...., but didn&amp;#39;t get it, she claimed &amp;#34;it didn&amp;#39;t fit on the tray&amp;#34;. Huh?<br&gt;We waited for the drinks. We waited for the food. We waited for the check. We waited and waited and waited. <br&gt;<br&gt;2) French country salad with approximately one beet, one asparagus and one tiny piece of cheese. Where was the erst? Maybe it didn&amp;#39;t fit on the tray...<br&gt;<br&gt;3) My 3 year old wanted Mac N cheese from the kids menu. When it arrived the top was kind of congealed. I tested it for heat, and it was luke warm, so my son proceeded to eat, but he ate from the middle and SCREAMED from burning his tongue. Seriously - Microwaved Mac N Cheese for kids? What the...<br&gt;We called the manger over who proceeded to explain in a derogatory manner that when cooking mac N Cheese they boil the pasta and cheese. No shit, of course they do. But NO restaurant with any sense serves PIPING HOT FOOD to children. Boil it all you want (or in this case microwave it since it was hot in the middle and cold on the outside) but make sure it is safe fro children before you serve it. The manager kept protesting and really didn&amp;#39;t get it. He offered a free dessert. Really, we should have made a huge scene, but we were frankly to shocked. Again, the manger didn&amp;#39;t understand what was wrong with serving piping hot, microwaved food to small children. He should NOT be working in the food industry and he is lucky our son wasn&amp;#39;t seriously hurt. But he now refuses to eat Mac N Cheese, or pasta, he was so scared from the experience.<br&gt;<br&gt;4) After this seriously disappointing meal we headed to the bathroom.
