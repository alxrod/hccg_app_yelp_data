If you come here with a group of people, my suggestion is to find a few entrees that you guys can share. The portion sizes here are huge, everyone is going to leave with it to go box. If that&amp;#39;s your plan then great, but if you don&amp;#39;t want leftovers just order less and everybody share!

You could just wait until you get home and make it nice stiff drink lol! My last tip is to try something different on the menu every time you go, because there are so many options. I typically always get the tide of my shrimp because I love, but this last time my sister told me to try their tamale corn cakes. OMG these gave me life!

As we waited we bought a few appetizers and drinks. We sat for about a good 2 and a half hours before our party arrived and which was expected because it was graduation season and this was the reason why we arrived early so that by the time everyone in our group arrived our table would be ready. So my friend goes to the hostess desk and tells her that everyone is there that we were expecting and she tells my friend that someone took our table. Excuse me? How can someone just take our table? So she tells us to wait a little longer and she should have us seated. <br&gt;<br&gt;We wait about another hour and by this time everyone in our party including the graduate and her mother is starting to get upset. We&amp;#39;ve had a very long day and all we want to do is sit down and eat. So I go up to the hostess desk and ask what&amp;#39;s the hold up? She tells me the same thing that someone took our table. At this point it&amp;#39;s after 9pm, \u00a0one of my friends goes up to the hostess desk and ask why hasn&amp;#39;t our beeper notified us yet and ask for the manager, the manager comes up and says she has no knowledge of us even waiting for a table.

I don&amp;#39;t believe this because how can someone just seat themselves with a waiter and everything? And they were complaining that the service was terrible. To make a long story long we didn&amp;#39;t our food until around 11pm. 3 so called managers came to our table and not one wanted to take responsibility for what happened. And one of them told us that he would take care of us and ended up leaving. My best friend and her daughter(Graduate) was so frustrated with the service they cried and the manager did nothing to accommodate us. We left our cold and over cooked food on the table. When the management only suggested that She take 20 percent off of the bill. Then threatened to call the police on us.

The seating is nice to view mothers beach, the marina and soak up some sun. However, you should know before trying the beachfront is the menu consist of the top 100 i teams from Cheesecake Factory extended menu so there a separate kitchen which prepares meals. My family came on Mother&amp;#39;s Day we waited two hours to be seated and decided to just take first option beachfront so we learned about the skinny menu. We all made orders according to the limited options. I understand the special day brought out the crowd but on top of two wait to be seated we also waiting almost additional hour for food to come out needless to say half the family was full off bread and appetizers. <br&gt;Now back to the reason I gave four stars instead of two. The hostess Rachell was very professional, patient and tried her best with the the chaos to lighten the family&amp;#39;s frustrations and hunger pains. <br&gt;Also, I have to s/o the manager Miner. He expressed his sincerity and apologize for the food not coming out in a timely manner which my dad was upset and requested his meal be boxed to go. Miner also comp some of the meals and desserts for the two special mothers.

I went here last night and I cannot believe the way I was treated. I was sitting at the bar while waiting for my table and wanted to order a skinny spicy margarita (they did not have the &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; option for this drink on their menu). They customized it for me and it actually tasted great. I liked it so much that when I was seated at my table, I ordered another one. This time it did not taste the same at all. The drink they brought me tasted very sweet and had a strong pineapple taste. There was no way that it was the same drink I ordered the first time. I nicely told the waitress that this drink tastes very sweet and I asked if I could just get a glass of wine. She told me that I have to speak to the manager. I thought that was weird because I&amp;#39;ve never had to speak to a manager because I didn&amp;#39;t like a drink that was made at any other restaurant, but I didn&amp;#39;t make a big deal about it. After speaking to 3 other waiters asking where the manager was, she finally came to the table 20 minutes later. By this time I had finished half of my dinner. The waitress also brought the wine I ordered at the same time as the manager coming. She asked what was wrong with my drink, and for the 3rd or 4th time I explained that it tasted too sweet and that I just wanted to have wine instead. She told me that she could remake the drink for me but she can&amp;#39;t take it off the menu because I customized the drink. I&amp;#39;ve never heard of this in my life. We were going back and forth for a few minutes and she kept telling me there is nothing she can do. SHE DIDN&amp;#39;T EVEN APOLOGIZE. She made it seem like it was my fault I didn&amp;#39;t like the drink because I customized it to make it &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34;. I asked her why they brought me a glass of wine then if the only option is to remake the drink. She said she will take the wine back since I didn&amp;#39;t drink from it yet, even though they already put it on my table. SO MUCH FUSS AND ARGUING FOR A DAMN DRINK! I also asked for water at least 6 times and didn&amp;#39;t get one until I was finished with my dinner and about to leave. <br&gt; Cheesecake Factory is a huge establishment with 210 locations across the US and they are not even able to apologize for a 10-dollar item that their customer didn&amp;#39;t like and remove it from the bill. RIDICULOUS. Not to mention, they still use PLASTIC STRAWS and don&amp;#39;t even have paper straws as an alternative. They also don&amp;#39;t have a vegan/vegetarian list in their 15 page long menu. Almost every item on their &amp;#34;skinnylicious&amp;#34; menu has meat in it. They clearly don&amp;#39;t care about the environment or their customers. All they care about is money. Soooooo greedy and disgusting. Large corporations like this should be involved in making a positive change for our planet but they are still promoting plastic!!!????? I&amp;#39;m in disbelief.

Well, here&amp;#39;s my review.<br&gt;<br&gt;I know there&amp;#39;s a common train of thought that it&amp;#39;s best to avoid restaurants like the Cheesecake Factory during holidays since the service can be overwhelmed and the food can be less than stellar. \u00a0I thought after avoiding restaurants during these peak periods, I might have had some luck and they would have gotten their act together. \u00a0With this Cheesecake Factory, it certainly wasn&amp;#39;t the case. \u00a0They need to do better and up their game, by a lot.

We have this second waiter just take the unopened bottle of wine away. Original waiter returns and 3 out of 4 of us order before he wanders off after asking my mother how she wants her side salad cooked. He was completely non-verbal beyond this bizarre question.

I know its a night before valentines so okay i give em a break. Waitress said they are making some more and will bring some out.<br&gt;<br&gt;Second my sister placed an order for enchiladas. The waitress comes back and says the kitchen ran out of enchiladas. So she has to place another order. Okay i give em another break its a busy night, it is after all the night before valentines day. Whatever we move on.<br&gt;<br&gt;Third, our order arrives by the manager (or the maroon shirt of the staff) last night. He knows my order is coming as he says the hibachi steak is on its way. When my order does finally come out not all of it shows up. The asparagas is still chillen in the kitchen. The waitress says it will be out soon.<br&gt;<br&gt;So great! I just have to keep my frustration in check and pace my meal in hopes that the asparagas will arrive in a timely manner. It doesnt show after 5 minutes. So i asked the waitress again about the asparagas...she says they ran out of the \u00a0batter and have to make some. Okay okay ill wait some more...So another 10 minutes later still no asparagas and the rest of my food is getting cold. Tick tock tick tock...<br&gt;<br&gt;So i proceed to eat my now cold food on my birthday at a cheesecake factory. ( oh boo hoo, boo hoo you didnt get your asparagas boo hoo yeah boo hoo to me ) <br&gt;<br&gt;Frustration in check again...So the waitress doesnt return, we have to call her attention and for some reason she is oblivious to the fact we dont have my asparagas yet. I ask if she can help us out here with the situation so she brings the manager/maroon shirt over.<br&gt;<br&gt;The maroon shirt acknowledges we didnt receive the asparagas and can only comp the value of what they call the garnishment of the plate or simply a slice of cheesecake. Im lactose intolerant. ( i know, what the hell am i doin here in he first place lol...well my gf and sis arent and there are other options)<br&gt;<br&gt;Up to this point my frustration has peaked and i could not enjoy the rest of the night. I asked the meal to be comped several times because the meal as it was described, did not show up in its entirety, and my sister complained about her first order not going through as well as about the bread. Its funny he said, &amp;#34;oh you should have told me about this&amp;#34;...really? Well were here telling you now! But the maroon shirt held to us to his options and could not comp any further than the asparagas. I was not happy at all. It must be corporate policy or whatever to not compensate for bad experience and incomplete meals.<br&gt;<br&gt;Meanwhile the asparagas is laughing in the kitchen giving high fives to the enchiladas who was probably kneading the dough for the bread ::sigh::<br&gt;<br&gt;My sis is a nice person she left a 2 dollar tip.<br&gt;<br&gt;And to just make it worse, we had to pay 6.50 for the valet service on the way out.

I mean stuffed!!!! It was garnished with salsa, guacamole and pickled onions and other stuff that tastes oh, so good! I couldn&amp;#39;t even finish it all!

The blackout cake was decadent. Dark chocolate, fudge, dense and moist...like...the ultimate chocolate make everything better cake. Again, I didn&amp;#39;t finish all of my cake. I gave it to my daughter who feverishly inhaled it. It was a huge slice of cake. <br&gt;We walked out to the beach and dipped out toes in the warm water afterwards. It is five dollars for valet (I was able to self park because I arrived before lunch crowd and it is cheap compared to other beachside parking lots) It was a pleasant way to end a fabulous lunch. This is definitely a place to go for whatever you fancy. They can accommodate and everyone is very attentive. My glass of strawberry lemonade never got empty because they were so on top of things. I even took the time to thank them via the online feedback from my receipt and got myself 5 bucks to use again...please trust...it will be used on my return trip. <br&gt;Ever wanna contemplate life, cheer someone up or stabilize your mood and fill your belly with delicious food...go and eat on the deck and just be.

I swear to God I cannot remember the black waiter&amp;#39;s name (something exotic and fruity sounding) but when I do I will update this post; HORRIBLE. <br&gt;<br&gt;First off for a Sunday wait was not bad. We were seated in like 10 mins...That was the shortest wait we had all evening.<br&gt;<br&gt;It took about 15 mins before we had ANY contact with any staff. A nice white gentleman (Jeff, I believe but not sure) came by, apologized and finally took our drink order.

Most restaurants, within 30 mins you could already sat, ordered and be halfway through a meal.

His exact words were, &amp;#34;Y&amp;#39;all need anything else&amp;#34;. Now by this point im pissed and puzzled.....You finally come over after being gone over 30+ mins and not only do you NOt introduce yourself but you address us as if we did something to you?!<br&gt;<br&gt;Took everything inside of me not to grab this idiot and toss him into that nice lake from the view we had...He ended up only coming by once more.

Family gatherings, birthdays and a simple Thursday evening dinner with friends. I&amp;#39;ve always enjoyed it, no complaints. The experience I had with me and my friends last night was unacceptable.

From the moment we sat down, took 15 minutes to get a &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;ll be with you in a second&amp;#34; &amp;amp; then that proceed to be another 10 minute wait. Once our waiter is here, no apology. Just mention there 3 waiters outside. \u200d what does that have to do with the customer. the dinning experience gets worst. It&amp;#39;s like the waiting game. No bread, no check ups, no refill on our water. Ridiculous! When I finally order, my dish isn&amp;#39;t even available anymore. So all we ate were 2 corn tamales plates that came out 15 minutes apart. By the time I found out the dish wasn&amp;#39;t available, we had already been waiting so long, why would i order anything else and sit there longer than I should. Last but certainly not least, we waited 15 minutes for the bill &amp;amp; had to remind the waiter twice for it. Makes no sense! This was an unpleasant, uncomfortable experience. The worst thing is when you look around everyone else is being serve nicely &amp;amp; enjoying their dinner while we are irritated and complaining the whole time to each other. <br&gt;<br&gt;Please train your employees to pick up the pace even if it&amp;#39;s a busy night, the customer should never feel the impact the restaurant is having.

So after not have being here for about a year we decided to have one last night out here before she returned home from her vacation. We were a party of 7 and already when ordering a table the girl looking for a table was being rude in her attitude. It was a Tuesday night around 8.30 and not too crowded. <br&gt;<br&gt;The service was NOT in any ways okay. We ordered simple drinks, water, wine and beer. Nothing hard or time consuming. The 3 waters came out, we waited. Appetizers came out before ANY drinks at all and we probably waited 20-30 minutes for a lemonade, 2 wine and 1 beer. Oh and yes they forgot the coke zero. The red wine was too warm assuming they had just ignored carrying out the drinks in time.<br&gt;<br&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t get any of the dark breads and when we asked the waiter said &amp;#34;no they hferklgm\u00f6sgmnls&amp;#34; and he left.

I don&amp;#39;t eat the white bread because I don&amp;#39;t like it and we were never bought any dark bread even after asking. So, I was STARVING, annoyed by the fact that the service had been so bad and just cranky. <br&gt;<br&gt;Oh food finally, we thought. we got 3 of the meals and waited politely for everyone to get their meals. You would think they would bring out everything at the same time right? Nope! Same as the drinks something came, something had to be waited for, and of course.... One meal had been screwed up so she got a small bowl of veggies but not her tacos and had to wait for her food even longer while everyone else had gotten their foods. <br&gt;<br&gt;Yes, desert time. Not everyone could order cheesecake so we need up only ordering 3 of them. Waited another 20 minutes for 3 cheesecakes to be boxed up and the check. <br&gt;<br&gt;Did i mention that not once did any of the 3 waiters approaching our table ask if we were okay, apologizing for all the mistakes and waits we had experienced and all they said was &amp;#34;Thank you for understanding and being patient.&amp;#34; NO we did not understand WHAT was taking so long and no we were NOT patient we were all hungry and cranky. <br&gt;<br&gt;Will probably NOT go back here again, at least not to the Marina location.", "rating": 1, "date": "9/14/2016"}, {"text": "Very disappointed!

So here we go...<br&gt;<br&gt; <br&gt;To give background, I called a month prior to make reservations considering the size of our party. I was told that no advanced reservations could be made for Saturdays and we would have to put our name in upon arrival and wait. Fine, no gripes there. <br&gt;<br&gt;This past Saturday (March 25, 2017) I hosted a large group dinner (27 people) at this location. The first person in our party arrived at 5pm and put our name in. I arrived at 5:15pm and spoke with my friend to inquire about the wait. She told me she was quoted 1 - 1 1/2 hrs at the most 2 hours. We agreed to wait. And we did so patiently. At 7pm we still had not been called and there were multiple large groups of 12 that came after us but were being seated. \u00a0The person who originally put our name went to the hostess to inquire. She was told that because the size of the group was the reason for the hold up. In response, the person who put our name in requested that the group be broken up so we could eat since 2 hours had already passed. Ten minutes later they sat 10 people from our group and a few minutes later they seated 9 people at two different tables leaving a remainder of 8 people. Keep in mind this is AFTER the &amp;#34;at most 2 hours&amp;#34; quoted time. <br&gt;<br&gt;It was about 7:30pm when I witnessed a group of 12 people who arrived after my group (I know because as I stated earlier we had been waiting for 2 hours) being called to be seated. At this point I am now angered. How is it that we are STILL waiting with a remainder of 8 people yet 12 who came after are being seated. I walk to the hostess and first thanked her for &amp;#34;attempting to be accommodating&amp;#34; and specifically said, &amp;#34;You do not need to wait for a table for the remaining 8 you can split us according to whatever is the next available. At this point we would just like to eat.&amp;#34; She called over Manuel and I told him the same thing. He said no problem. I understand. \u00a0He indicated there was another table of 12 about to leave and we could have that one. \u00a0I said thank you, however we do not need to specifically wait on that table. We would like what is next available whatever number that is. He said ok. <br&gt;<br&gt;Fifteen minutes later, the hostess calls the next table (not us) a group for 6. I immediately asked how is it that another group that was not here before us is being seated. I just requested to take the next available table. The hostess calls Manuel. I pose the same question to him. He tells me &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t understand how it works.&amp;#34; \u00a0I refreshed his memory on the conversation he and I just had and instead of accommodating he brings Jonathan over to speak to me. I again explain the scenario. And expressed my distaste in service. \u00a0I told him we had been disrespectful to no one, had waited patiently and at this point were being straight up lied to. \u00a0After this conversation Jonathan seated our remaining 8. The time is now 8:15 pm (I know because I looked at my watch). <br&gt;<br&gt;As my party was seated I spoke to Jonathan who I believe was the highest manager available at the time. I again thanked him for attempting to be accommodating and seat us all together and also reiterated why I was upset. He tried to explain his side by saying other patrons were quoted times and they needed to be seated accordingly. I refreshed his memory that we were already an hour over the time quoted to us AND that Manuel (another manager) had just told us we would have the next available table yet tried to give it to a different party. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall I could not believe this experience. We had 27 people who were dining in your restaurant about to spend at least $700 or more and you push us to the side. Jonathan didn&amp;#39;t even want to give a courtesy appetizer. I mean for goodness sake we waited 3 hours!! People were walking by saying &amp;#34;you guys are still waiting, wow!&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;Marina del Rey location please get it together. This is NOT the way you treat customers.

But this one is very well deserved. I went in and ordered a meal two entr\u00e9es and two pieces of cheesecake. Difficult right? Pretty simple right? I wasn&amp;#39;t asking for seven or eight entr\u00e9es and nine pieces of cheesecake and drinks!! I had ordered over the phone because it was the most simplest way I could imagine placing an order. I have my daughter pick it up for me and when she got to cheesecake factory she asked if that was the whole order. The lady behind the counter looked stressed out according to my daughter. She also told me that it look like she had multiple orders and that there was a very long line of people waiting for to go orders. After my daughter drove 8 miles home with a meal that we ordered I was shocked to realize that they did not give her the correct order. In fact they shortchanged her one entr\u00e9e. When I called the restaurant to find out where my other entr\u00e9e was it must&amp;#39;ve been the manager on duty it was a gentleman. I didn&amp;#39;t catch his name but he seemed rude trying to justify what had happened with my order. Saying that my daughter was in a furry and washed the lady at the counter. I know my child I know she&amp;#39;s not the kind of person to rush people. Maybe cheesecake factory need to re-staffOr re-train their staff. If your staff can&amp;#39;t handle high stress situation as like a dinner rush maybe they shouldn&amp;#39;t be working the counter. I worked in the restaurant industry for 15 years and never have I send Sophie accused that it was my daughter&amp;#39;s fault that the order wasn&amp;#39;t wrapped properly. Normally into Chewase should like this or whoever is in charge of answering the phone during the dinner rush is extremely apologetic and take for Santa building for the incident.

Just a lil tidbit on our friendship..it revolves around food. Since our UCLA days we&amp;#39;ve been major foodies and made it our mission to eat. We plan our days around food and manage to out-eat everyone around us...including our 200+ pound boyfriends. <br&gt;<br&gt;We stopped by a little after 5 which sucked since we missed their lunch menu but I was planning on ordering off their small plates menu so I didn&amp;#39;t care too much. We were able to get seated right away and found a great spot outside, I can&amp;#39;t really say much about their food because it&amp;#39;s a chain restaurant and every Cheesecake has the same menu. This particular location has a great view which is just an added bonus to their already affordable prices and generous portions.

We ordered the avocado rolls for appetizers and the food tasted right, as I would expect it to. <br&gt;<br&gt;I was not thrilled about having to valet and pay $5/$6 to have someone park my car a few feet away from the restaurant but it makes sense to charge since it is a beach. If the parking was free then everyone would park there.

(Again, anyone who has ever visited this restaurant knows, the food is within arms reach of people walking in or out of the seating areas.)<br&gt;<br&gt;It was a nail. Yes, you read that correctly. In some way, I would have liked to assume that it was a fingernail, but it almost looked too large. I&amp;#39;m thinking to myself, that HAS TO BE a toenail! A TOENAIL! I turn back to my husband and ask: &amp;#34;Is that a nail?!?

That seems to be a good option to control the massive amounts of horror stories that can likely occur with so many people in one place, at one time. Because of this decision, you have horrible wait times (to be seated and to be served), disgusting bathrooms, frazzled (and sometimes rude) workers/staff (although our waitress was nice, so we made sure to tip her generously), overworked/slow cooks and dissatisfied customers.<br&gt;<br&gt;*FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANGE THE LAYOUT. There is absolutely no reason why there should only be 2 stalls in a women&amp;#39;s restroom, when your restaurant capacity is (supposed to be) 135, and your employees use the same restroom! (I only know your exact restaurant capacity, because I think I read everything on your walls, during my wait to be seated. Smh.) I would imagine that changing the layout would also help with patrons and staff running each other over, while trying to navigate throughout the restaurant.<br&gt;<br&gt;*FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP THE FOOD AREA INACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC. This needs no further explanation.<br&gt;<br&gt;And with that, I close. Rant over.", "rating": 1, "date": "7/2/2017"}, {"text": "My experience was horrible. First when we were seated it took our server Ron over 30 minutes to take our order. However, \u00a0we watch him attend to the two tables on either side of us. Within the 30 minutes it took him to get to us we asked for bread to hold us over. He seemed to be very irritated by our request. My friend expressed to him that she was not happy with her drink and if he could ask the bartender if it could be stronger. He said that he would. He returned to our table 2 times with no response to her questions. She then asked he said that no it could be, and left the drink on the table. The third time he returned she then asked if he could return the drink as she was not satisfied. The next time he came to our table (which was over an hour of us being there) he was clearing the table and spilled 2 full cups of water on the table which spilled all over 1 of my friends and her phone, it spilled on half of my other friend, and spilled a third on myself. We were very shocked as this has never happened and wanted to complain. But our other friend said we have not received our food and to not cause a scene as he might tamper with our food. We assisted with him with getting the water off the table and asked him to please remover the wet bread, silverware, and wet napkins off the table. He did not! We asked for more napkins as we used ours to help him with the water. He came back with the small paper bar napkins ( yet another slap in Our faces). Our good then came to the table. Two out of the 3 plates were cold. We asked him and napkins, and the food being cold and he said, &amp;#34;you are asking for too many thing at once and I&amp;#39;m getting nervous. When I get nervous I start spilling things like water on people&amp;#34; and he then laughed. That was it and we asked for the check. We asked if he could split the check and he then said, &amp;#34; that would take too long, he had other tables to attend too&amp;#34;. I then asked for the manager. I had never experienced such terrible customer service before. I explained all of what happened to the manager. He then stated he would have to get the senior manager of 16 years as this was above his level that he could handle. Steven the senior manager came over and listen to what happened. He stated he would comp the two means that were could as we didn&amp;#39;t eat them and give us a free cheesecake. He then asked to pack up our meals and disappeared. When he returned with our food he wished us a good night and told us he would send the first manager over to handle our checks. Once our checks came nothing was comped. We only received free cheesecake. This is truly unacceptable! This experience has made me not ever want to come to this establishment again!

From the delectable foods and ambrosial ambiance to the delightful decor \u00a0and surprisingly speedy service, this location cannot be rivaled. <br&gt;<br&gt;The main purpose for going to this location was to catch it to have dinner before the sunset! Apparently that didn&amp;#39;t quite work since I live in Southern LA area and it being LA traffic was a major factor.. I didn&amp;#39;t quite make it on time and got there when the sun was already in! Either way I still go to enjoy the perfect weather and breeze this place offers.<br&gt;<br&gt;Upon arrival the inside looked quite small so the hostess offered the &amp;#34;Beach Front&amp;#34; which I had no idea what it was, thought the patio was where we were going to be seated, I was wrong, this place is actually closer to the water and from what I heard she said its &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34;. I was amazed how everything look well set up... you have fire pits, cabanas, lounge etc. It was just amazing how everything looked, you wouldn&amp;#39;t think it was Cheesecake Factory... and that is why I say.. THIS IS THE BEST ONE I&amp;#39;VE BEEN TO! Another thing you have to keep in mind if you want to dine in the Beach Front.. they only offer the Top 100 dishes on their menu.<br&gt;<br&gt;Now on to the service!.. Service was GREAT and our waiters name was IAN. I asked what drinks he recommends and which will have a better acquiring taste! He was on top of things very polite and never once did he disappear after he took our order (which usually happens at most places.) I assume at times waiters know who looks like a &amp;#34;BIG TIPPER&amp;#34; so they tend to cater more to those people. But that was not the case here because I sure don&amp;#39;t look like or dress the part of a BIG TIPPER, but in this case I did not mind putting down a 15% from a $133 bill. I never put that much down as a tip, but felt like he really deserved it!<br&gt;<br&gt;Now on to the food!.. Since I was outside and its only TOP 100 dishes, to me they all sound good. Dishes I got to try were:<br&gt;<br&gt;Fried Macaroni &amp;amp; Cheese Balls: (10/10) WOW!!.. ORGASMIC!!.. I shed a couple of tears after trying this. Soooo cheesy and the taste was just incredible. With the first bite I really didn&amp;#39;t wanna share the rest, wanted all 4 of them for myself!<br&gt;<br&gt;Chicken Alfredo: (10/10) This is definitely on my TOP 3 Alfredo List!.. One good thing that gave it a plus and out-shined the others was the BIG chunks of chicken that come with this dish!.. enough said.. THIS PLATE IS A MUST!<br&gt; <br&gt;Crispy Chicken Costoletta: (10/10) I&amp;#39;m a picky eater so when I saw asparagus I just glanced over on to the next item.. but here comes IAN to the rescue again and recommended this dish. So took his word and I was really amazed. It was 3 thin sliced breast and lightly breaded which makes it better (too breading makes certain items not worthy) and for the side dish was mashed potatoes!... and what makes these potatoes better than others?.. RED POTATOES &amp;amp; CHUNK BITES!!.. So it&amp;#39;s not all that mushy (hope that&amp;#39;s a word!)<br&gt;<br&gt;Reese&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake: (10/10) GRAND FINALE was this... ORGASMIC!!!... TWICE!!..

As a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory as a no-brainer go to (virtually anywhere) I feel extremely disappointed in my experience over the past weekend at this particular location. First and foremost, I am very aware of the long wait times at all cheesecakes and this review has nothing to do with the initial wait time. As this location is a beachfront location we decided to sit in the beachfront portion which is partially separated from the main portion. After about 45 minutes of waiting, we were seated. I went to the women&amp;#39;s bathroom and it was a one stall bathroom which was filthy. We notified the restaurant. After being seated our waiter came to take the order. I had to repeat myself several times because he didn&amp;#39;t want to write anything down on paper. Also, he acted very odd when we asked for simple requests. Our first request was a bread basket. It took us 55 minutes and asking two waiters maybe 7 times to get the bread basket. Second, I ordered a glass of wine. My wine came in a dirty glass. Since our waiter was long gone my mother decided to take my glass back to the bar to get it changed. After swapping the cup, the bartender told her to tell the waiter and that they should bring another glass on the house. We put in our order and after the 55 minutes when we got our bread we got a notification from the waiter that one of the items we ordered is sold out (which was just grilled artichokes btw). Ok great, tell us after an hour. I opened my napkin and silverware to find that my fork had a very disgusting unidentified something on it. I called another waiter and complained since ours was nowhere to be found. He then made a face himself and took the fork and promised me plastic silverware for me and my family (which never came). The food came all wrong, my aunts margarita had pickled jalape\u00f1os on it, and everything tasted not as good as it usually tastes. The waiter brought me another glass of wine after my father had to explain to him that it was dirty and explained to him that the bartender said that it should be replaced. Literally no common courtesy to replace it without an explanation. The waiter was the most odd waiter I have ever had. None of the waiters were communicating with each other either. When we asked for anything it took so long to get it that we just wanted to get out of there. They never cleaned the table they barely wanted to bring us anything we asked for. I felt as if the waiter thought it was a chore. At the end, we got our check and the waiter had TRIPLE charged my wine, which was dirty in the first place, after he brought me a second one. Anyway, we complained to the manager about the check and I started to vent about how its just been an extremely terrible experience. He apologized and told me I should have told him earlier. To end this review, I would like to say that due to the lack of cleanliness that I witnessed in those few hours I would never recommend that anyone I know go here until they fix these issues.

Normally, service there is great and the food and customer service is above average....but when I tell you yesterday was TERRIBLE it was absoulutely UNBEARABLE. My husband and I arrived to the bar ( where we always sit in order to get FASTER service with food and drinks) for cocktails and food. After waiting for about 40 minutes for bread, one entree and crab bites the bartender informed me that the runner forgot to bring our food....EVEN THE BREAD..... in the mean time... table after table and every other bar patron recieved our food. So after a couple cocktails and no food later I told the bartender that we could just leave if we are not going to be served any food. So he was very friendly about it and got the manager. The manager Amanda came out and assured us that the food would be there right away and was not !! It took another 20 minutes... and the order was wrong !!!! ugggh fast forward..... when she brought out the food again I asked her if it was safe for me to order anything else or would it take another hour.....she reassured me it would come out right away. IT DID NOT ......after another 40 minutes or so I saw Amanda casually pass by the bar and I stopped in asked her ....where are the chicken sliders? To her suprise she asked ...they didnt bring them yet? I told her no...then she went in the back and in about 10 minutes later she brought them out. LMAO.... when I tell you they ruined our entire experience...it would be an under statement. So then, in the end they took the 7 dollar chicken sliders and 7 dollar crab bites off and we paid 20 bucks for our pasta and 61 bucks for our drinks. I also tipped both off the bartenders 5 dollars a piece because they made pretty good drinks. Oh then she had the nerve to ask my husband and I if we were going to pay the bill...

Today for lunch, we tried one new item and one tried-n-true dish. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;The Farmhouse Burger is new. I guess it replaced the old Ranch House Burger (an old fave). The good news is that the Farmhouse one is $2 cheaper, very unique, and also very good. \u00a0It&amp;#39;s an Angus Beef patty covered with Grilled Smoked Pork Belly, Cheddar Cheese, White Onions, Iceberg Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo, and a Fried Egg. \u00a0That&amp;#39;s right: Grilled Pork Belly and a Fried Egg?!?! \u00a0 The egg is a runny Sunny-side Up that oozes all over the burger once you begin to eat it. \u00a0Because of the egg, this burger won&amp;#39;t be for everyone, but it sure was an amazing combination of flavors in one very messy burger. \u00a0The burger comes with fries, but for $1 extra we upgraded to the delicious Sweet Potato Fries. \u00a0My only recommendation for this burger would be to upgrade the lettuce as it seemed to add nothing. \u00a0Romaine or possibly spinach would be better. \u00a0But I digress. \u00a0For me, the Farmhouse Burger is another win for Cheesecake Factory. \u00a0Check out the picture uploaded with this review to see it.<br&gt;<br&gt;My wife went with her favorite CF dish: \u00a0Miso Salmon with Snow Peas and White Rice. \u00a0Even the lunch special at $7 off was almost too big to eat. \u00a0It&amp;#39;s a classic sweet teriyaki-ish sauce on the grilled salmon that brings \u00a0back memories of happy summer days in Tokyo.<br&gt;<br&gt;For an appetizer, we tried something new (for us) that isn&amp;#39;t quite new at all: \u00a0Stuffed Mushrooms. \u00a0They were tasty, however, seemed a little overcooked by about 30-45 seconds leaving a slightly charred taste on the tender mushrooms. \u00a0They are stuffed with Fontina and Parmesan Cheese, Garlic, and Herbs served with a Wine Sauce. \u00a0The mixture of cheese and wine sauce was loved by my wife who enjoyed dipping the sourdough bread in it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Service was great as the hostess seated us quickly and then moved us from our original seat to a better one on the upper outdoor balcony with a great view of Mother&amp;#39;s Beach when we requested some shade under an umbrella. Our waiter was a bit slow at first because the place is seriously busy, but he warmed up to us as the meal progressed and even gave us two To-Go Cups of our drinks: Passion Fruit Iced Tea and an Arnold Palmer. The Arnold Palmer is served in a regular tea glass rimmed with sugar (like Margarita salt, but sweet). It is a nice (and very sweet) touch.<br&gt;<br&gt;Valet parking is always $5, so we took the Water Bus over from Fisherman&amp;#39;s Village for $1 each way and enjoyed the ride through the Marina. If you want to avoid valet, there is a lot nearby that offers self-pay spots.<br&gt;<br&gt;In addition to the previously mentioned food, my recommendations for any Cheesecake Factory remain the same: \u00a0Buffalo Blasts, Avocado Eggrolls, BLT Salad, Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, and the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club.<br&gt;<br&gt;Finally, we got a slice of cheesecake to go. \u00a0It was a dilemma choosing between the 1200-calorie Red Velvet or the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream. We went the Tuxedo route with layers of Fudge Cake, Chocolate Cheesecake, Vanilla Mousse, and Chocolate. Of course, it was delicious.<br&gt;<br&gt;With its nice view, full bar, great selection of tasty specialties, and stellar service, the Cheesecake Factory of Marina del Rey stands out as an excellent dining option if you can afford the wait.", "rating": 5, "date": "9/6/2010"}, {"text": "I normally don&amp;#39;t really care for Cheese factory but a good place to go if your out with friends and can&amp;#39;t come up with a place to eat.

Some restaurants are SUCH pricks about this, and I don&amp;#39;t get it. If a restaurant charges over $10 for a dish of food, the sodas should come rolling out. If I can score free refills at McDonalds for $1.39, then I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to deal with shelling out $5 per coke at a place that&amp;#39;s already taking my $12 for a plate of chicken tenders. \u00a0((deep breath)) Okay... settling down. Kind of a pet peeve.<br&gt;<br&gt;This spot in particular, next to the Marina&amp;#39;s endless lines of boats, has always served up the fantastic eats. A little pricey at first glance and then you get your order... and holy sh!t, the portions are gar-gantuan. Worry not. Your entree is enough to satiate you; you needn&amp;#39;t order an appetizer, if the budget&amp;#39;s tight.<br&gt;<br&gt;That being said, another way to go is to order a couple of appetizers instead of ordering an entree. This is both cost-effective and provides you with some variety, instead of leftovers. <br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s truly rare that I find myself at a restaurant in which I&amp;#39;m stumped, as far as menu options. The entire Cheesecake Factory menu is appealing. It&amp;#39;s a gift... It&amp;#39;s a curse. Because you want EVERYTHING, it sometimes makes it hard to order, but at the same time, at least everything is good. My poor friend had to deal with my indecision during recent visit; how do you decide which ONE to get when seventy five different things are beckoning. <br&gt;<br&gt;The bottom line: It&amp;#39;s all about taste preferences. This is like a TGIF that learned to turn up the quality and diversity of their food a few notches. Yet another restaurant at which you don&amp;#39;t have to ask, &amp;#34;What&amp;#39;s good?&amp;#34; The answer is: &amp;#34;What SOUNDS good? Because everything is good, so if it sounds good, it IS good.&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;In my humble opinion, don&amp;#39;t waste your time with conventional fare, here.

I&amp;#39;ve never experienced valet parking at all-let alone at a Cheesecake Factory, although I&amp;#39;m aware it&amp;#39;s fancy enough to merit one. Whatever, we&amp;#39;re hungry, it&amp;#39;s only $5, we pay it. <br&gt;<br&gt;We get inside, the person taking names and handing out those little buzzers that go off to let you know you can get seated isn&amp;#39;t very attentive. In fact, it looks like she doesn&amp;#39;t want to be there. She&amp;#39;s more concerned with primping. There&amp;#39;s another girl standing right next to her who is kind enough to ask us how many in our party, and that triggers the other girl behind the computer to ask my name, tells me it will be a 30 minute wait, and hand me a buzzer. Why they need two girls up front to split that task is beyond me, but at least one of them was pleasant.<br&gt;<br&gt;We finally get seated and our server is so nice! She&amp;#39;s on task about giving us refills, asking us if we need anything else, etc. So that was one good part about our meal. I ordered the chicken marsala, and my sister ordered the lemon herb chicken to share with my niece. My little brother ordered the kid&amp;#39;s pizza. I&amp;#39;ve had the chicken marsala at at the Irvine location, and I very much preferred Irvine&amp;#39;s. It was juicier, more flavorful and the pasta was al dente. The pasta at the Marina Del Rey locaiton was bowtie, and pretty darn undercooked. Not even al dente. More like, it was 2 minutes away from being al dente. <br&gt;<br&gt;Unfortunately did not have any cheesecake with our meal because we didn&amp;#39;t have any room (the portions are HUGE) and we didn&amp;#39;t want to trek back in the car with perishables.

She seemed really stressed and seemed like she was having a terrible day. My mom has a food allergy to mushrooms and we ordered a pizza and 20 mins later the pizza arrives by a different waitress covered in mushrooms! Whether it was the waitress or one of the chefs who didn&amp;#39;t get the order correct it wasn&amp;#39;t a big issue we just asked the woman who gave us the pizza to please remake it. Our original waitress came back and this time she seemed like she had real attitude when my mother asked to please make sure they didn&amp;#39;t just pick the mushrooms off and then bring it back out (sorry these things happen....). Instead of seeming sympathetic she sort of got aggressive and kept saying something like &amp;#34;we all know&amp;#34; already when my mom asked why the pizza had mushrooms on it. Then she condescendingly at the end of one of her remarks called my mother &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hon&amp;#34;. And so it began....<br&gt;<br&gt;Food: My parents ordered the Mediterranean Salmon which came with potatoes and artichokes and tomatoes. They said their food was very good. From what I saw it looked good and the portions were huge! I ordered the SKINNYLICIOUS\u00ae Fresh Vegetable Salad. I noticed it said pomegranate dressing which seemed new to me so I tried it. I love pomegranates and I know how they taste so when my salad came out it looked good and I had a couple bites but knew something was off. Every bite I took the dressing tasted like car motor oil. Of course I&amp;#39;ve never tasted car oil but it had that weird aroma too it. idk how to describe and when you would try to wash it down with some water it would burn. I&amp;#39;m usually not too picky but at this point we agreed it would be better to request for a new one since I was ready to puke. After a while the manager came out and was super nice! He is the reason why I am adding on another star. He apologized to my mom and gave us a complementary corn soup which was super delicious. He was very humble and attentive unlike the waitress who was agitated at that point. The new salad that they gave me was great and I got balsamic vinaigrette on the side I recommend that or at least taste test whatever the hell they put on the salad. Overall this salad tasted amazing and fresh the second time around! After some time the waitress came back and asked how the salad was and I told her it tasted way better. Of course at this point everyone in my family was tense and I just wanted to go home. Since it was my mom&amp;#39;s birthday we ordered 3 cheesecakes. 2 raspberry lemon ones and one chocolate one. That experience went smoothly at least there was some moment of positivity with all the chaos. The cheesecake was great too! We didn&amp;#39;t finish all our food so our waitress came back and was struggling bagging everything and later when we got home the corn soup was spilled all over the bag....Also good luck getting water in this place...I had to track down like 3 men to fill up the glasses of water. They were super chill though and service was fast on that. <br&gt;<br&gt;I just want to thank the manager so much for stepping in and helping resolve the conflicts. I&amp;#39;ve worked in food before and understand the frustration with people, orders, and tension but man what a buzzkill to someone&amp;#39;s birthday -_- Thank god we had a $75 gift card here because the food came out to about $100 not including tip and for the experience it was not worth it!

I was really excited as I&amp;#39;ve never been here before and I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to go. When we got there they asked us how many people were in our party which it was only the two of us. They told us to stand by this plant to wait to be seated. It took a few minutes and a someone came to assist us. They gave us the option of indoor or outdoor. I&amp;#39;m glad we chose outdoor because it was very beautiful outside. That&amp;#39;s where the good stops. So as we were being seated my husband informed her that it was my birthday. She told us where to sit, and gave us our menus. Another lady comes by and asked us what we will be having. We weren&amp;#39;t ready yet so she gave us a few minutes which felt like maybe 60 seconds. She seemed very impatient. So after her second time around we gave her our drink and appetizer order. She carded me and that&amp;#39;s when I got my happy birthday. After that we didn&amp;#39;t see her for about ten minutes or more. She didn&amp;#39;t bring our drinks or our appetizers. Another man came and brought us our drinks and we still waited for our appetizers. She then reappeared when a group of guys were seated next to us. They told her that it was one of the guys birthday and she told him happy birthday they proceeded to order and she left and still didn&amp;#39;t come back to check on us. After some more time went by she came back and asked for the rest of our order which at this time we&amp;#39;ve spent most of our time just waiting for her to resurface so she can take the rest of our order. We order two entrees and a dessert. She then disappeared again, came back and took more of the groups order. We finally received our appetizers from someone else. At this point I&amp;#39;m becoming a little agitated because after all I&amp;#39;ve never been here and it&amp;#39;s my birthday and I expected a better experience. I was still willing to sit it out but the last straw for me was that a few servers came to that group singing happy birthday and gave them a cake with a candle. A group that came after us. Not only that then all of their food started coming out. So then she tells them that she was going on break and if they needed more help that the back up server can assist them. She comes over to us and she says I&amp;#39;m going on a mandatory break during that time no one will be taking my place I will be back after my break. Goes to the next table and repeats what she said to the first table. I was in such shock so when the replacement server came out with the rest of our food I asked for a manager. He came over immediately and I explained to him that I don&amp;#39;t understand how that group got their birthday song and cake before I did. And he said he knows it my birthday it comes after the food which clearly it doesn&amp;#39;t because that group got theirs before their food started pouring out. I told him that I didn&amp;#39;t want anything more than what we have eaten and drank and that I wanted the check. He tried his hardest to keep us there. He kept insisting that we stay and that he would serve us and they already made our food which at that point I don&amp;#39;t care that the food was already made. I don&amp;#39;t appreciate waiting on a server with an attitude for an hour on a Monday when they weren&amp;#39;t even that busy. The type of service she gave us deserves negative stars. Management needs to retrain her or fire her because what people don&amp;#39;t realize is that you are the face of your company so what u put out to your customers will ultimately determine how the visit goes. So even though this place had a great scenery and some awesome sliders the service was horrible and the management was very pushy about us staying even though I told him no well over six times. What I can credit him for is the fact that he gave me a complimentary cheesecake to go. So good job on that, but it doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that my birthday dinner was ruined.

After dinner, we both realized we did not have cash. The valet does not take credit cards... this is one of my problems. It is 2013 and accommodating for credit cards is not far-fetched at all. Also, if this is the case, the restaurant should at least have an ATM on hand. However, the valet does not take credit cards and there is no ATM on site. Here is where the valet worker started with his attitude. We simply asked what the option is when people have no cash and he starts yelling about there being an ATM across the street at a liquor store. <br&gt;After a bit of back and forth trying to figure out where this store was (it was next door around the restaurant), my boyfriend started walking over to the store. I handed over my ticket and after a few seconds I found a $5 bill in my purse. So I figured he would bring the car before the boyfriend would make it to the store anyway and I could pay him and leave. I am waiting alone in the cold at night in a shirt with no sleeves. The man goes over to where the keys are kept and I figure he&amp;#39;s getting the car. All this time passes by and still... no car. Even if I was waiting for him to return with cash, they could have brought the car over for me to sit in to the side as I have seen them do before. I ask one of the other attendants where my car is and he just says &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t know&amp;#34; quickly and now takes another two sets of keys from a man that walked out of the restaurant. Their cars come. Mine is still not here. The boyfriend comes back from the store and asks where is the car? I still don&amp;#39;t know either. I walk over to them and before I even say anything, the initial man yells &amp;#34;I am getting it!&amp;#34; This was so rude and disrespectful. In my attempt to keep my cool, I just shrug it off and say &amp;#34;well your tip is gone.&amp;#34; My car was finally brought out and now I have to wait behind these other two cars with people who also don&amp;#39;t have cash.

They keep the heaters all over the patio cranked up to eleven. <br&gt;<br&gt;Also, about whole cheesecake orders:<br&gt;Order your cheesecake at least 2 hours in advance if you want it to be ready to eat by the time you stop by to pick it up.They keep their whole cheesecakes in a freezer until someone orders one, so if you walk in expecting to get a 10&amp;#34; Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake all ready to serve in five minutes, don&amp;#39;t hold your breath.<br&gt;<br&gt;And as for the sometimes sub-par service:<br&gt;I know by the time you actually sit down and are ready to order you probably had to deal with all kinds of things(a line for the valet, a line to get in the door, waiting for your pager to buzz, etc.),but try to keep in mind that while you are experiencing all of this crazyness, so is the staff, and they have to keep it together while balancing all of their orders and special requests, tracking down a manager, and being stopped for something by someone every time they walk by. \u00a0(The CCF is known as a hard restaurant to work at because of the stress involved.) Now of course that does NOT excuse poor service.You went out because you wanted to have an experience and it may not matter to you what the staff may be going through. In this case, just remember that you ARE having an experience, so enjoy it. You&amp;#39;ve got great food, a great view, and some great company. If you rush the experience you went out for, what was the point? Let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re waiting to be seated and it&amp;#39;s going to be a while. You can talk to the person/people you came with, look at the cheesecakes, even ask the bakers for some recommendations.The point is to relax and enjoy the entire experience and look at the glass half full.<br&gt;<br&gt;So that being said, my girlfriend and I have made a list of some of our favorite items and also popular items:<br&gt;<br&gt;APPETIZERS:<br&gt;Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls<br&gt;Avocado Egg Rolls<br&gt;Buffalo Strips<br&gt;Tex Mex Egg Rolls<br&gt;Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes<br&gt;Thai Lettuce Wraps<br&gt;<br&gt;ENTREES:<br&gt;Miso Salmon<br&gt;Louisiana Chicken Pasta<br&gt;Cajun Jambalaya Pasta<br&gt;Chicken Madeira<br&gt;Chicken Bellagio<br&gt;Pasta Da Vinci<br&gt;<br&gt;APPETIZER AND ENTREE SALADS:<br&gt;Ceasar Salad<br&gt;Chinese Chicken Salad<br&gt;BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad<br&gt;Seared Tuna Tataki Salad<br&gt;<br&gt;DESSERTS:<br&gt;Original Cheesecake<br&gt;Adams Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake<br&gt;Tiramisu Cheesecake<br&gt;Stephanie&amp;#39;s Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake<br&gt;Keylime Cheesecake<br&gt;White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake<br&gt;Lemoncello Cream Torte<br&gt;Dulce de Leche Cheesecake<br&gt;Linda&amp;#39;s Fudge Cake<br&gt;Strawberry Shortcake<br&gt;<br&gt;One final note: Don&amp;#39;t go to the CCF if you&amp;#39;re on a diet.

The Kitchen is in the front left side of the restaurant and located between the entrance of the restaurant between a very small and tight pathway and the hostess table where customers checks in. People walking and stopping in between this short walkway bumping heads and feet. <br&gt;The Kitchen&amp;#39;s counter top is where the chefs put the plates of food out for the waiters to serve. It is on a low level, reachable counter. With customers and employees walking in and out, I can just imagine the dusts and germs flying all over the food. When we were walking out of the restaurant, I witnessed this guy sneezing. Didn&amp;#39;t cover his mouth and a plate of salad is left there on the counter where his saliva probably flew into the salad. :-( GROSS!! <br&gt;<br&gt;Here goes our journey.. <br&gt;Pulled into the parking lot and parked by the the cleaners. The valet guy comes over and screamed, That&amp;#39;s pay parking! I said excuse me sir? he said, &amp;#34;Paid Parkin, I said.&amp;#34; <br&gt;I gave him the $3.50 he asked for and he didn&amp;#39;t give me a ticket. I asked for a ticket and he said no need. How the heck do you charge me for Valet parking and don&amp;#39;t put a ticket on my car. What if another valet driver don&amp;#39;t see the ticket and get my car towed??? There was another car that pulled in. Obviously he had a complaint too because We were both waiting on the Manager to come talk to us. <br&gt;We spoke to the manager and she apologized behalf of the valet service and just explained that each location and city has their own parking policies. Fine, I respected that. So then she went out right away to tell the Valet service guy!! .. Uh, wait a minute, should I leave, what if they do damaged to my car out of anger.. sigh... <br&gt;<br&gt;(You see, the Redound Beach location where I go to most of the time has a small parking spaces for handicap parkings, take outs and a few limited regular parking spots for people who doesn&amp;#39;t want to pay for valet parking. Marina Del Rey has those parking spots too, but they choose to charge their customers for the parking. ) <br&gt;<br&gt;While being served, Our server wasn&amp;#39;t too thrilled about the fact we wanted refills on their bread. Well, sometimes, I go there for their delicious bread, but not like we didn&amp;#39;t order any main dishes. We did!! <br&gt;The water with lemon the waiter served us, 2 out of 5 cups tasted funny.. There was a goat cheese like after taste in my water!! My Mother said the same thing about her cup of water. We called the waiter and nicely asked him if he can exchange the water for us. I even showed him the greasy residue that was left on our cups. He said sure and walked off like we bothered him. NO Sorry?.. NO, explanations?.. NO excuse us for not washing our cups clean enough!! We were NOT difficult customers and even try not to bother him too much. He wasn&amp;#39;t as friendly as I expected it to be, because I have high expectations of friendliness customer service from them. Well consider me spoiled by the other Cheesecake Factory locations. If something like this would happened, a manager would of showed up at our table with the waiter and apologized behalf of their business. <br&gt;<br&gt;What do you expect when you go to Cheesecake Factory??

My son, who was the hungriest of us all had to wait on his dinner for about 10 minutes longer. His order was supposed to be everything minus mushrooms and \u00a0sub fries for mashed potatoes. What came out was hibachi jerky, VERY dry with sauce on the side laid on top of sprouts and mushrooms, no asparagus and the requested fries never came.

Because there always such a long wait for a table, we arrived mid-afternoon, hoping they would be less crouded. It was. We walked right in, only to find the hostess station un-manned. We waited a few minutes but no one showed up. We looked to the bakery immediately behind us hoping to ask for help there, but it was un-manned as well. After about 10 minutes someone showed up and we were seated. As the hostess sat us down, she explained that we might have a longer than normal wait, as the waitress was busy.

She assured me it was very strong and only Italian men needed the extra shot. The coffee arrived so weak it looked like a few spoonfuls of coffee added to a glass of milk. Worse, it was barely lukewarm. I tried to get her attention before she walked away, but could not. It took quite awhile to get the attention of ANY server.

Out of their pastas, I love the four-cheese pasta, the carbonara, or the farfalle with chicken and garlic. Their salads are amazing too, I usually never order salads when I go out because I never feel like its really that satisfying, but at the cheesecake factory, they are tasty enough as a meal and definitely fill me up, especially the BBQ chicken or the luau salad.

The only things I&amp;#39;ve gotten there that I wouldnt get again are the fish and chips, which I thought were bland, and the belgium waffle, which was just like any other belgium waffle. <br&gt;<br&gt;Anddd of course, I can&amp;#39;t forget about the amazing bread they start you off with!

We bought 4 cheesecakes and were not offered the sundaes because we bought the cheesecakes. However, their policy is, if you don&amp;#39;t buy a cheesecake, then they will give you the free sundae. Very odd logic to me, since, if we had known this ahead of time, we would not have bought the cheesecakes. Customers should be rewarded for buying their cheesecakes, not for NOT buying them. When the cheesecakes arrived, we also didn&amp;#39;t have any knives for a long time and had to use our forks to cut them. The cheesecakes were not particularly good and just tasted greasy.

Honestly, the menu is a book, so if you don&amp;#39;t like something, you can always order something else next time.<br&gt;<br&gt;That said, the service is what makes or breaks a location, and the service at this location is amazing, at least when you have Delisa (spelling?) as a server. <br&gt;<br&gt;We shared servings of the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes (at Delisa&amp;#39;s recommendation, but only available during Sunday brunch) and the California Omelet. Both were delicious, but the pancakes were fluffy, and almost creamy. I know that&amp;#39;s weird for a pancake, but it gave a nice tangy flavor along with fluff - amazing. <br&gt;The omelette, while yummy, was relatively basic. The real star of that dish was the potatoes we got on the side. I know that sounds silly, but they were perfect.<br&gt;Another yummy thing we has was their espresso, which was well made and sweet.<br&gt;<br&gt;One thing that could VASTLY improve this location is their mandatory valet.

Employees fighting, people that man the phones taking personal calls in front of customers etc. I found out another one last night when My GF and I went to this place around 930 for dinner. It was busy so they quoted a half hour wait but did say there was open seating at the bar...we saw two people get up so we figured if there was a full menu it would do. We sat down and their were two bartenders working, one stocky guy with a beard that was going a mile a minute and a young looking asian girl who was barely doing anything. Took about 10 mins to be acknowledged and then got our drinks placed next to the previous customers dirty plates (asked if he could clear it for us and was met with the response of &amp;#34;will get to that in one second&amp;#34;). After we got our food we might as well have been invisible, needed a couple of things (tobasco, salt and pepper) and had to ask one of the waiters walking by, he looked annoyed and shouted at the bartender to come over and help us. The thing that made it akward was we kept noticing the girl bartender talking to two other patrons for most of our visit and ignoring pretty much everyone and everything else. We didn&amp;#39;t put two and two together till she started EATING off the peoples plate and other employees kept stopping by and saying hi to them. It was then obvious that these were other employees on there off time and the bartender was better served eating with them and talking about how she had gone here and there the night before then making sure we had condiments for our food. This went on for literally the entire hour we were eating, my GF kept looking at me in shock like &amp;#34;they are really carrying on and we can&amp;#39;t even get our card run so we can leave&amp;#34;. Some places do not allow employees to fraternize at work in their off hours, I never agreed with that but there is a fine line where professionalism is lost because you want to BS with your co worker...this is not good practice in the restaurant business. The food was very good, but we got the basic apps and a piece of cheescake (kind of hard to F%$k that up).

Yes, the table was clean and ready for customers to sit, we checked. After sitting at the table which was really cramped up, we felt very uncomfortable. Example, there were unopened unbrella posts and round umbrella basses which were disallowing my girlfriend to sit comfortably. I asked for the manager, he pulled the table back a few inches. This really did not solve the issue. The right thing to do was to , even if we needed to wait a few moments, was to change tables. Manager did not do his job.

This place can be a mad house during the dinner rush, but its usually well worth the hassle. The staff definitely goes out of their way to make your experience positive and pleasurable. <br&gt;After being told that the wait for a table was an hour and a half we were directed to the downstairs beach side patio, where we could order drinks while we waited. This waiting patio is a GENIUS idea! No one likes to sit in the cramped lobby of a restaurant next to 30 other families awkwardly waiting to be seated. This patio was not crowded at all, was right near the water with beautiful views of the boats in the marina, and being able to order cocktails definitely makes the time go by faster. The cocktails at Cheesecake are some of the best Ive ever tasted, my favorites being The Ritz or the Peach Bellini. It&amp;#39;s super easy to rack up a significant bill before you even get to eat dinner. <br&gt;Once we were seated we asked for extra bread due to the number of people in our party, a request which the waiter quickly fulfilled, bringing us enough of that delicious brown bread for a lifetime. MMMM brown bread = so good! We all ordered our entrees and continued sipping on our beverages and munching on bread until the food arrived. I ordered the Chicken Medallions, which, in my opinion, is one of the healthier options they have (they feature A LOT of pasta and carb loaded dishes). The waiter either heard me wrong or wrote down the wrong thing, so I received the Chicken Madeira instead, which is delicious in its own right, but just not what I had ordered. I informed him of the problem and he apologized and quickly ran to the kitchen to correct the mistake. Upon returning he offered me a salad or soup on the house while I waited for the correct dish to be prepared. I asked for baby greens with balsamic, which was totally yummy and distracted me from the fact that all my friends were eating their food while I was still waiting for mine. Then TWO different managers came by our table to apologize some more, and they offered to buy me another Ritz martini on the house as well. I have never experienced such amazing customer service in my life! My food was ready in a reasonable amount of time, especially considering the snafu, and I got a free salad and drink out of the deal. I couldnt really ask for anything more.

The meals were brought out by different people, and each plate at different times, and none of the servers knew which table to go to. This appeared to not just be an isolated event as I watched this occur over and over all evening... Servers milling around with food going from table to table until they found their intended guests... Really strange. The food seemed marginal, not exciting. I had the fish tacos, my wife a steak, and my son the factory burger. For desert, I had the velvet cheese cake, and my son had a hot fudge sunday. Again...

The chef was willing to open up a fryer just fro me so that I could have gluten free sweet potato fries.
