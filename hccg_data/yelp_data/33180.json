Normally this could be accepted if the restaurant was overly busy (or we were actually a party of 4) but it was right at opening so more than half the tables were open. In fact, they were so empty they had sections that were &amp;#34;closed&amp;#34; whatever that means. I wish i could my business under that pretense of &amp;#34;clopened&amp;#34;. I&amp;#39;m sure the folks at Cheesecake Factory corporate offices probably think when their restaurant is open it&amp;#39;s fully open not partially open but they can decide that aspect.<br&gt;<br&gt;The hospitality industry is about being hospitable. When I asked to speak with a manager about putting us at a table for 5 they said we would have to sit inside or squeeze into 4 as the mall doesn&amp;#39;t allow 5 tops for fire code and the other section outside that could accommodate our group was closed. <br&gt;<br&gt;Having spent over 20 years in this business I have never heard of this policy. I had a professional career working for BR GUEST Hospitality and Starr Restaurants and a Masters in Hospitality Industry Studies (yes I have a masters for some crazy reason in this crazy business) and i have never heard of such lunacy. Yes you have to keep pathways clear but tables that are next to each other can certainly move to create larger tables. <br&gt;<br&gt;I also have copied a picture of my bread plate, my spoon, and the salt shaker to let you know that the place is filthy and it&amp;#39;s probably the same manager in charge of this. <br&gt;<br&gt;I hope cheesecake reaches out to me because I would love to hear their position.

I told her we had 7 and a baby and she with attitude said 30 minutes then when handing me the buzzer said now it&amp;#39;s 35. I let it go because we were just trying to have a good night. Then when we were finally being seated they told us with a party of 7 and a baby that we had to squeeze into a booth set for 6 when there was plenty of available tables. The hosted said 6? I said no 7 and a baby and she said oh so 8 and walked away. Didn&amp;#39;t help us, didn&amp;#39;t get us to a correct size table, didn&amp;#39;t make sure we were comfortable or correctly set up. Just walked away. We ended up leaving before we ever sat down because no one would help us. There was 3 hostesses and 3 servers standing by, even when we asked they just looked at us.

Anyways we finished the dinner I ask the waitress for dessert and sing happy birthday so she came with the cheesecake but there was no happy bday sing when they had just sing to the table next to us.

I asked the waitress and she told me I need to tell my waiter or waitress how I like it cooked. I looked at her like you are our waitress. I never knew that and told her I wish she would have mentioned that to me because each restaurant has a different way of making food. She said yeah and just ignored the whole response.

I went to one of the girls at the front and told her about the conditions the bathrooms were in and all they said was &amp;#34;oh, ok, we&amp;#39;ll close the handicap stall&amp;#34;. What about tell the customer &amp;#34;we&amp;#39;ll have someone take care of this right away&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;we&amp;#39;ll have someone clean the bathrooms right away&amp;#34;. No, nothing like that. All they said was they&amp;#39;d close that one bathroom stall. I never saw them calling their manager to let him know how disgusting those restrooms were. I had to go to the mall&amp;#39;s restrooms to have my daughter pee because I did not dare have her go near the ones in that restaurant. Can not believe the difference of the mall&amp;#39;s restrooms cleanliness compared to the restaurants. I&amp;#39;d think it&amp;#39;d be the opposite. PLEASE KEEP UP WITH YOUR RESTROOMS. THEY ARE DISGUSTING AND FOR THAT ONE REASON, I WILL NOT GO BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT. My server was great, no complaints at all. But the restrooms were DISGUSTING.

As I do not eat chicken I gave it to my companion as my server didn&amp;#39;t come back for a few minutes. The steak was again well done again and at this point I no longer feel like eating, but the server sends out the steak (hopefully cooked correctly) in a to go bag. When we ask for the check, my dish is still on it. Given that it was sent back as many times as it was I figured I at least given a discount, having not been able to eat my meal. So the manager comes out and very rudely says that we should be thankful because I got 3 plates for the price of one.... meaning the 3 plates that were messed up and were sent back. She then asked where the chicken on the 3rd plate went, and I said my friend took it since I don&amp;#39;t eat chicken. She then said that she would have to charge my friend for it if she was going to take it, even though we never ordered it.

They then proceeded to call several other tables while we waited for almost 20 minutes. We went up to the counter twice within the 20 minutes to tell them we were waiting. On the second time we went up to the counter the lady told us &amp;#34;We called you, you didn&amp;#39;t hear us&amp;#34; Which after she said that I was appalled. Forgetting about that we were taken to our table by another lady. When we got to the table it was covered with bread crumbs and spilt drinks.

When she was placing the menus down we asked why we didn&amp;#39;t get a booth (another party of four came a sat down right after us) she said &amp;#34;Those are for parties of 6&amp;#34; even though they were the same number party as us.

We got our fire roasted artichokes and they were supposed to be served warm but were slightly warm on the inside and cold on the outside. We called the manager to ask if they were supposed to be served cold or hot because different restaurants serve them in different ways. It took an average amount of time to get the rest of the food. The food was okay we got three entr\u00e9es and one appetizers. We started eating and it was all fine. Then as we were eating my brother found plastic in his shepards pie.

Oh, I am definitely into this restaurant for the cheesecakes, too. But, food is definitely great, too. Ralph called before getting there to make a reservation but it was impossible for some reason. So, I went straight to the Cheesecake Factory to the host to tell her I needed a table (and mentioned that it was to celebrate our 3rd yr anniversary, which was true.) Her face kind of lighted up and said it could be ready around 20 minutes. I was never given the vibrating pager, which I found out. Oh, well. I said that I could be back in 30 minutes instead and checked my watch at the same time and rushed in the mall with Ralph and did what we had to do. I got back inside maybe 5 minutes late. I waved at the same hostess and she said to wait a moment. Then, another 5 minutes passed by, some guy in white uniform called out my name really loud in front of me. lol.. I was right there. <br&gt;<br&gt;The waitress was a cool girl, who had sense of humor and a great smile. We first went with the spicy chicken salad. We should have ordered the Luau one, but next time. We also shared an appetizer of avocado egg rolls, which was heavens to both of us. I decided to get a Passion Fruit Mojito. It was delicious. I really appreciate the fact that our waitress (sorry, I wish I remembered her name) warned us that we might not like the Pomegranate Mojito. She said that the pomegranate might not blend in well with the mint in the drink and many people didn&amp;#39;t like it. That was nice of her to point out. :) Then, we went for the Splenda cheesecake with fresh strawberries and whip cream. I usually get the Godiva chocolate cheesecake, however, I wanted to be nicer to myself by not gaining too much of the sugar since I&amp;#39;ve already been drinking two of the tall glasses of passion fruit mojitos. I was almost knocked out when I got home. Very nice way to mini celebrate out 3 years of being together before marriage. :) I love Ralph!", "rating": 4, "date": "3/12/2009"}, {"text": "I found a bug in my ceasar salad, the waiter call the manager and he only discount one salad, and we were eating 3 we left the place with a note saying &amp;#34;&amp;#34; clean the kitchen&amp;#34;&amp;#34; my birthday lunch was a horrible, the bug was big.", "rating": 1, "date": "12/13/2009"}, {"text": "Very disappointed in Cheesecake Factory today. \u00a0Went to the one in Aventura and while the service was good, the food was overcooked and the mens room was a mess. \u00a0Ordered a Kobe burger med-rare and it came out well done. \u00a0Lemon Ricotta pancakes were too hot to eat. \u00a0Usually get much better food from this chain. \u00a0Maybe it was just an off day?", "rating": 3, "date": "10/30/2011"}, {"text": "Food is consistently good...
