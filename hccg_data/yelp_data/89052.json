My last couple of experiences have not been so great. Specifically with the location on Green Valley Pkwy. <br&gt;<br&gt;My first bad experience - my daughter called to make a reservation in a week in advance because she wanted to take me to my favorite restaurant for dinner. We arrive on time and still had to wait and additional 20 minutes which turned out to be 30 minutes and they pretty much forgot that we were even there. I had to go back up and ask the hostess what was going on and after she saw I was irritated we were seated in no time at all. <br&gt;<br&gt;My second bad experience - because I&amp;#39;m nice and had high hopes, I decided to try the curbside pickup. I called, and placed my order. The lady taking my order, asks if I want utensils and I say, yes please. I ordered the Steak Diane with potatoes and asparagus. My girlfriend ordered a Rib-eye steak with potatoes and asparagus. My ordered and repeated back to me and confirmed to perfection or so I thought. <br&gt;<br&gt;I arrive to pick it up. This dinner costs us close to $70 and I&amp;#39;m picking it up so at minimum I&amp;#39;m expecting everything to be in the bag. Once we get home, we are excited for our steak dinners and movie night at home. Open the bag and pull out our meals and everything appears to be as I expected then boom, no utensils. Furthermore, I pop the lid and to my surprise, I have no mashed potatoes with my meal. <br&gt;<br&gt;I called the same night and spoke with a very nice lady who reassured me that a manager would be calling me the very next day to discuss compensation and she apologized that I didn&amp;#39;t receive what I paid for. I trusted that I would hear from someone. Yet, here we are a whole week later and nothing. I live in Henderson and this location is closest to me.

It would have to be a restaurant. And a chain one, at that -- my personal guilty pleasure is the Cheesecake Factory, which is infamous for being one of the most ridiculously unhealthy restaurants in the States ( with many of its foods clocking in at over 2000 calories by themselves, and that&amp;#39;s not including the cheesecakes they&amp;#39;re famous for! ).

Since Cheesecake Factory was open after the event, that made my decision easy for me -- I ordered the chicken samosas, the steak Diane, and a slice of the cherry chocolate cheesecake.<br&gt;<br&gt;Of course, the Cheesecake Factory provides complementary bread for one to munch on while waiting for the food, and it is quite tasty, though I admit I didn&amp;#39;t eat too much of the bread as I intended to save room for my order. The chicken samosas were surprisingly light, flaky and flavorful, though I didn&amp;#39;t care too much for the cilantro cream that they were served with ( and is the only reason why I&amp;#39;m docking a point on this otherwise great outing ). The steak Diane was the better of the two dishes; medium rare steak with mushrooms, onions and a rich sauce -- all of these combined made for a savory dish that I consider one of the Factory&amp;#39;s better options, as some of the NUMEROUS menu items tend to vary in quality.<br&gt;<br&gt;The real star of the night was the cheesecake, however; true to its name, the Factory has numerous types of cheesecakes for all tastes, though for this meal I settled on the cherry chocolate cheesecake since I wanted something that wasn&amp;#39;t too overly sweet ( LOL ). In that respect, the cheesecake was perfect: rich, decadent, creamy and studded with plenty of cherries and chocolate. Normally you&amp;#39;re not supposed to finish the entire slice, but with how good it was I couldn&amp;#39;t help but inhale it!

I have never been disappointed in a meal at any location. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service can occasionally be slow if you come around 3-4pm which we usually do, probably shift change. We like that time because it&amp;#39;s generally not packed yet. Friday and Saturday day evenings you can expect to wait for a seat. National Cheesecake day is also pretty crazy but their service is pretty decent and quick. <br&gt;<br&gt;Before I cared about what I ate, I used to order off the regular menu. The portions are so large you can split three ways or bring home leftovers...the leftovers taste even better sometimes! I still LOVE the avocado egg rolls and the sauce that comes with them. Must try! The bread they bring is always good as well. This time the bread was nice and warm. The brown bread and sourdough are equally delicious. <br&gt;<br&gt;Skinnylicious menu- this is the menu I usually pick from now. The servings are more normal and the calories are MUCH lower. Don&amp;#39;t let the word &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; fool you, all the food on this menu is huge on flavor and still satisfying! My favorites are the Mexican lettuce wraps, the flatbreads, burgers and the side salad that comes with the burgers/sandwiches. <br&gt;<br&gt;Cheesecake- really, you can&amp;#39;t go wrong!! I eat off the skinny menu so I can easily eat dessert. Top ones for me are original(so good), chocolate tuxedo mousse, red velvet, and Godiva. If you bring me any cheesecake on the menu I will eat it though. They also have a low carb cheesecake. Or if you&amp;#39;re wanting a guilt free dessert you can opt for a bowl of strawberries. I usually bring my cake home to enjoy later.<br&gt;<br&gt;Ambiance- it&amp;#39;s quite pleasant inside although it can get loud. The booths are better than tables. Sometimes with a table you can end up sitting next to some very uncomfortable people who just sit there and awkwardly stare at each other. <br&gt;<br&gt;Cheesecake Factory has been one of my all time favorite restaurants!

I was pleasantly surprised to only wait 2 minutes for a table. That almost never happens at Cheesecake Factory. That&amp;#39;s where the positives pretty well came to an end. <br&gt;<br&gt;For starters, it took our server almost 15 minutes to see us for the first time. I get that a busy restaurant requires servers to attend to a lot of customers in their section, but waiting 15 minutes just to see us the first time and take drink orders is pretty bad. It also unfortunately set the tone for our service through the rest of our meal. <br&gt;<br&gt;We started with fried Mac and cheese, which ended up being pretty good. It took a while to get to the table, but it was delicious. I decided to order the tempura fish tacos. Having to decide from 150+ menu items isn&amp;#39;t my favorite thing but it is what it is. <br&gt;<br&gt;Unfortunately, the fish tacos were horrible. The batter wasn&amp;#39;t all the way cooked and the fish smelled horrible. I get that you can&amp;#39;t expect super fresh fish from a chain restaurant, but it was awful. The pieces of fish didn&amp;#39;t even fit in the tiny tortillas they put them in. I could only stomach 2 before calling it quits. <br&gt;<br&gt;The shortest time between waitress visits was between taking our plates and bringing our check. Needless to say, I won&amp;#39;t be back. We were thinking about getting cheesecake for dessert but didn&amp;#39;t want to spend another 30 minutes and 10 dollars here. We filled out our check and got out of there. <br&gt;<br&gt;I take some of the blame for ordering fish tacos, but if Cheesecake Factory can&amp;#39;t produce something that at least tastes ok, then take it off the menu....or at least make your service passable. Unfortunate, but that&amp;#39;s how it goes sometimes.", "rating": 2, "date": "7/22/2018"}, {"text": "Every thing was delicious.

I&amp;#39;ve been to Cheesecake Factory&amp;#39;s in the past where this has happened.<br&gt;<br&gt;After we sat down we were greeted by our waitress Andrea R. Very knowledgeable, very friendly and patient. DEFINITELY, three important qualities needed for working here as a server. <br&gt;<br&gt;We started with avocado egg rolls and buffalo blasts. Avocado egg rolls, as always were fantastic. Buffalo blasts were great as well, however it seems there&amp;#39;s a little too much extra breading around the outside. I&amp;#39;m sure for the cooking style it&amp;#39;s beneficial, and they are still very delicious otherwise and definitely a sufficient enough portion. <br&gt;<br&gt;Since the dishes are so plentiful, I chose to order an additional appetizer, the Crabcakes. They were fantastic (even though I only enjoyed one of the three) and served fairly well. The only adjustment to this dish I would make is how the Crabcakes are served. They are presented on a bed of Chinese noodles (little foam type noodles). As you cut through the Crabcakes the noodles stick to the Crabcake and it changes the consistency of the bite. The crabcake itself was DELICIOUS. But, it would have been far better if I didn&amp;#39;t have to fight noodles through every bite! <br&gt;<br&gt;After dinner I had the Adam&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Fudge Cup Ripple Cheesecake and it is wonderful. Not too sweet, very satisfying if you&amp;#39;re a chocolate lover. <br&gt;<br&gt;The service here is excellent, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere like any Cheesecake Factory is comfortable.

I asked him for the soup of the day and he said it was chicken tortilla so I looked at my daughter and said soup sounds good and I proceeded to ask the waiter if it was spicy and he said oh yes it&amp;#39;s extremely spicy I said OK let me think his response was so do you need another minute? I said mmm no I&amp;#39;ll get stuff mushrooms and for her the kids Alfredo sauce I asked if I can get it with chicken he said sure if that&amp;#39;s what you want. We waited a few mins no juice yet he had only brought me my sprite. A few more mins passed and he had a tray of bread in his hand I taught that was ours n said thank you but quickly realized it was for the table next to us since that table had bread he dropped it of. After a few mins he realized my daughter did have her juice and said oh let me go get the apple juice. Our food finally came but not once asked how was our food. He definitely asked the lady&amp;#39;s next to us how their food taste did everything come out well etc. After a few mins of eating my daughter had it with the high chair and wanted to be carried (just to clarify she wasn&amp;#39;t screaming or crying etc she only raised her hands and gave me the sign to get her out) I was carrying her still eating and the waiter comes and points at my daughters plate and says should I pack this to go. I said hmm sure after being shocked by it. As I finished eating he immediately proceed to ask if we wanted the check or any dessert \u00a0at the point I was uncomfortable and in tears that all I wanted was the check and to run out!

This time, we were influenced by $50 in gift cards to dine on a Wednesday night around 7:30. Our party of seven waited about 15 minutes outside before we were greeted by our server who was kind enough to come outside and lead us inside to our table. The menu can be overwelming with endless choices. But that is good for our group which has a pretty wide spectrum of preferences. There hasn&amp;#39;t been too many changes to the menu over the years with the small plates and Skinnylicious options being the most recent to me. For the rookies, don&amp;#39;t go hog wild on the bread, because you won&amp;#39;t be able to finish your three-serving portion entree.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our order was pretty varied which included two entree salads, three sandwiches, a pasta dish, and the filet medallion off the Skinnylicious menu for me. There was plenty of &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; vegetables and not a lot of beef for my entree as expected, but the vegetables were cooked and seasoned well. The pasta dishes have never really impressed me, but the salads are surprisingly good. If I don&amp;#39;t get a steak dish, I&amp;#39;ll usually get the tuna tataki salad which is a very flavorful salad. Everyone was happy with their meals with over half us needing take out boxes. We finished with two pieces of cheesecake. Over time, I&amp;#39;ve found that I prefer cheesecakes without any cake mixed in like the fresh strawberry, banana cream, and salted caramel.<br&gt;<br&gt;I do have to comment on our server who left a good first impression by greeting us outside, but everything else really wasn&amp;#39;t up to par. To add to the rehearsed, corny jokes where the response was crickets chirping after each one, he had no organization of our orders. Stating that I was seat 1 when taking drink orders and my daughter was seat 7 sitting across from me at the end of the table, he had no clue who drank what when he brought the drinks out, auctioning each one and running back and forth across the table. He forgot my mother and wife&amp;#39;s glasses of wine, didn&amp;#39;t notice they were without beverage after three return trips to the table, and he had to be reminded by me to grab them at the bar after 15 minutes. Then he did the always annoying checking every three minutes if I had signed the receipt after he ran my credit card. Which meant he was cut and wanting to bolt, but you don&amp;#39;t want to perturb the person that is signing off on your tip.<br&gt;<br&gt;Before gift cards were discounted, our check was a reasonable $163. What you&amp;#39;ll get with Cheesecake Factory, as you will with other successful chains, is consistency. They need that consistency to handle the amount of volume that comes through the doors. The food and atmosphere in this location are also consistent with every other restaurant. The changing variable is the service, which is usually a hit.

However, I had an awful experience today that warrants a one star rating. <br&gt;<br&gt;In honor of national cheesecake day, the Cheesecake Factory is offering half price cheesecake. What a deal! And it is. But who knew that you&amp;#39;d have to deal with snotty, rude and unprofessional employees in order to get your piece of the pie, or cheesecake, in this instance? <br&gt;<br&gt;So I go in and it&amp;#39;s busy. Like really, really busy. And of course it is! The best cheesecake on planet earth is half off! I go right to the counter line and after waiting for about 5 minutes (which was actually quicker than I thought it would be considering how busy they were) I got to the counter and get not so much as a hello, hi, what can I get for you? Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Just a girl staring at me waiting for me to place my order. Ok-they&amp;#39;re busy and she&amp;#39;s probably stressed. I get that. No biggie. <br&gt;<br&gt;I requested 4 pieces of cheesecake - 2 Reece&amp;#39;s, 1 snickers and 1 salted caramel. Alas, I was informed that it&amp;#39;s only 1 piece half off per person. Since I&amp;#39;m there by myself, I&amp;#39;m basically only able to get 1 piece at the discount and the rest will be full price. No problem - it makes sense to put a cap on it so that people don&amp;#39;t go crazy. I decide that I don&amp;#39;t want to pay full price for 3 pieces and adjust my order to remove the salted caramel and just ordered 2 Reece&amp;#39;s and 1 snickers. <br&gt;<br&gt;I pay and even leave a small tip ($3) in the tip cup. I walk away from the counter and a couple minutes later she calls me back to get my cheesecake. I look in the bag and unfortunately there&amp;#39;s 1 Reece&amp;#39;s, 1 snickers and 1 salted caramel. NOT what I&amp;#39;d ordered, paid and even TIPPED for! This, my cheesecake loving friends, is how the rest of my visit went - verbatim:<br&gt;<br&gt;Me: Oh shoot, I didn&amp;#39;t want the salted caramel. That was the one I cancelled. <br&gt;Her: So what do you want then?<br&gt;Me: 2 Reece&amp;#39;s and 1 snickers. I&amp;#39;m sorry. <br&gt;<br&gt;* At this point she ROLLS HER EYES and SHAKES HER HEAD, takes out the salted caramel and walks away. I am so disappointed and feel like I&amp;#39;m putting her out when in all actuality, it was HER that made the mistake and ME that was being apologetic about it. Huh? *<br&gt;<br&gt;Me: (out loud and to no one in particular) Not sure what that attitude is all about. <br&gt;<br&gt;The manager is standing there and overheard my comment and this is how the remainder of my visit went, again verbatim:<br&gt;<br&gt;Manager: Well you know what it is, ma&amp;#39;am? We&amp;#39;re not even supposed to be doing this. <br&gt;Me: You&amp;#39;re not supposed to be doing what?<br&gt;Manager: Giving half price for take out orders. We&amp;#39;re actually only supposed to be honoring it for dine in customers. <br&gt;Me: Well I certainly appreciate that you&amp;#39;re honoring it but I don&amp;#39;t think the attitude that comes along with it is necessary. <br&gt;<br&gt;And at that point I got my CORRECT cheesecake and walked out. <br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s unfortunate that the manager chose to defend his employee ROLLING HER EYES and SHAKING HER HEAD at me rather than apologize for her completely unprofessional and unjustified behavior. Like I said, I get that they&amp;#39;re busy. I understand that it&amp;#39;s a stressful job. And I definitely appreciate that they honored the discounted price when, apparently, they didn&amp;#39;t have to. But as a customer, I should not be treated that way, especially when the mistake wasn&amp;#39;t mine and I was kind and gracious even when she made the mistake. <br&gt;<br&gt;Shame on this employee and shame on this manager (both whose names I didn&amp;#39;t get, dang it).

Egg rolls, chicken and waffles Benedict, and an omelette. So no exaggeration whatsoever it took literally almost an hour to receive our food. On top of it there were tables that sat around us three to be exact that had been there probably 10 or 15 minutes and received their food at the same time we did and we waited an hour. I am almost sure the server forgot to put in our food and to be honest if that was the case she should&amp;#39;ve communicated that to us instead she barely even checked on us at the table. Then when we decided to mention that the eggs Benedict came out with the eggs over hard and she clearly stated that&amp;#39;s not how they should&amp;#39;ve come out she offered to pull the plate so they can make another one. Now let&amp;#39;s keep in mind we already waited an hour for our food so why would we have a plate pulled to be remade. We felt like we were in inconvenience to our server. She didn&amp;#39;t care about our experience because honestly when you go out for a birthday brunch I think what you are paying for is not just the food but the experience of it all!", "rating": 1, "date": "5/6/2018"}, {"text": "I eat here every time I&amp;#39;m in Vegas. \u00a0It&amp;#39;s truly a personal favorite. \u00a0The food is fantastic! \u00a0There&amp;#39;s something on the menu for everyone. \u00a0For me, at The Cheesecake Factory, it tastes like somebody cares. \u00a0Love this location.", "rating": 5, "date": "12/7/2017"}, {"text": "Came in for lunch.

The primary reason I stopped dining with them was because of their calorie-heavy menu (they have pasta dishes that exceed 2,000 calories!). The menu features a list of items that were specially curated to not exceed 490 calories for appetizers and 590 calories for entrees and some items from their regular menu that happen to be under those thresholds. However, as I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve guessed, the portion sizes are cut dramatically. They apparently don&amp;#39;t know how to cook filling and healthy dishes.<br&gt;<br&gt;Off their SkinnyLicious menu, I&amp;#39;ve tried the Santorini Farro Salad (farro, cucumbers, tomatoes, beets, red onions, feta cheese, tzatziki, and vinaigrette) and Chicken Samosas (crispy wrappers filled with spiced chicken with cilantro sauce). Both surprisingly delicious and not overly terrible for you. The salad was ridiculously small and there were four tiny samosas. The prices weren&amp;#39;t bad, but it&amp;#39;s sad considering the fact that those dishes were still loaded with calories and fat.<br&gt;<br&gt;I was surprised that their Fried Calamari (served with garlic dip and cocktail sauce) was really good. Also, I&amp;#39;ve had their Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad (grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, grilled corn, black beans, cucumber, and Romaine) with the dressing on the side. It was tasty and it was such a large portion that I couldn&amp;#39;t finish it.<br&gt;<br&gt;The SkinnyLicious menu is great, however, it&amp;#39;s really hard to love a place that serves dishes that have more calories than you should consume in a day. It&amp;#39;s a shame that a lot of diners are really oblivious to restaurants&amp;#39; nutrition information and obviously, restaurants don&amp;#39;t want to be transparent about it.

Here and there she would grab our drinks to refill without asking and wouldn&amp;#39;t say a word, never spending even a second at the table to give us a chance to ask for anything.

I was expecting our server to show up and ask us how everything was, or to ask if we need anything else but no nothing. Since we were seated near a server station my husband waved down another server who was standing around conversing with another server. She fingered hold on to my husband and finished her conversation. She finally came over and asked my husband if he needed something and when he said we needed a side of ranch, and buffalo sauce she ran off to get it. Another server (still not ours) brought the ranch, and said she&amp;#39;d be back with the buffalo sauce. 2 minutes later, the buffalo sauce finally arrived. After our meals were almost done another server saw that our drinks were low, and offered to refill them. Once completely finished, our server finally arrived and asked about dessert.

I got the calamari which is lightly breaded and extremely tender and juicy. It comes with 2 different dipping sauces, but the calamari is so good it can stand on its own with a little lemon juice. I like ordering off of their SKINNYLICIOUS menu which are items that are healthy and less calorie. The Arugula Salad containing Arugula, Marcona Almonds, Golden Raisins, Parmesan, Lemon and Olive Oil.....is sooooooo light and refreshing and is a great accompaniment to something that is fried. <br&gt;<br&gt;So I sat there, watching some people make a connection and others look like they were ready to go.

Ain&amp;#39;t no other way to say it. Let me explain why.<br&gt;<br&gt;I pull into the parking lot and am waiting on my wife to show up as she&amp;#39;s on her way. I call and speak to &amp;#34;Frank&amp;#34; who tells me the wait list is only 5 minutes. I&amp;#39;m only 5 spaces from the front door and can see both front doors so...I&amp;#39;m thinking we&amp;#39;re going to be good to go. Well 4 min later we&amp;#39;re walking in the door and I get told the wait is now 20 minutes. Wow, that&amp;#39;s quite a jump in only 4 minutes and there wasn&amp;#39;t a horde of people rushing the door. Either someone can&amp;#39;t count or someone was lying...got a hunch the counting ability is just fine....<br&gt;<br&gt;So we get on the list, get our pager and then cool our heels outside. And outside stinks. Literally stinks. Like has anyone emptied the trash by the benches? Finally after a 25 min wait someone comes out and calls for us by name...the pager never did go off. I got the excuse that it doesn&amp;#39;t work outside. Hmm, I guess having equipment with a range of 100 ft from the base station is asking too much. <br&gt;<br&gt;So we finally get seated. And service...well, it was slow. You wait for bread. You wait for drinks. You wonder if the waiter went to the bar to watch the baseball game on TV. You wonder if there will ever be peace in the Middle East. And then you get to place an order.<br&gt;<br&gt;When you finally get your food well quite frankly it sucks. My soon to be 3 year old wanted chicken strips and he wanted apple juice. He picks up the juice, starts to move the straw to his mouth and is rewarded with an apple juice shower as the lid was not snapped all the way down on the cup. Nice...now I got a soggy kid. And that soggy kid ate some of the french fries but spit out the chicken. As for my wife, she ordered Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. She ate about 5 bites before she pushed it away. And I ordered a Mexico City Chicken dish that was marginally passable, but after a couple of bites it left my mouth feeling...well it&amp;#39;s starchy...or like it&amp;#39;s powdery..it&amp;#39;s just weird. 2 hours after leaving the place my wife and I still have this strange aftertaste from their food. I&amp;#39;ve never really had an aftertaste like this before. Again it&amp;#39;s just weird. <br&gt;<br&gt;From walking in the front door until we left took almost 2 full hours. We spent $80 and ended up leaving well over 3/4 of our food for Republic Services to send to the Apex landfill. I can write that it sucked, but quite frankly that&amp;#39;s understating just how bad it was. <br&gt;<br&gt;My wife said to show mercy and give 2 Stars? Not a chance. If it sucks it sucks. Call it as I experience it and be done with it. 1 Star. And when you see penquins inside the gates to Hades, you might see me darken their doors again. Until such time...oh no Boo-Boo. Ain&amp;#39;t going back here even if you tried to drag me in. <br&gt;<br&gt;(With apologies to my wife who had a rough day and I thought a good meal with cheesecake might brighten her day, but instead these jackasses made it even worse!

One of us does not do well with fish or anything too exotic, so the Cheesecake Factory was a safe bet. <br&gt;<br&gt;The portions here are large, bordering on insane. Some items are average in price to quantity ratio such as the potstickers, but then there are ridiculously big selections such as their chicken nachos. We started with these two appetizers and a few drinks. Looking through their menu is daunting. Flipping through page after page, it all becomes a blur. It took us twenty minutes to settle on our meals. <br&gt;<br&gt;Many of these plates could easily feed two and my friends did not want to split an entree with me. It definitely made me appreciate their Skinnylicious offerings. All of the items on this separate menu possessed less than 590 calories. It is not like other places that only have a few selections to choose from. No, this was a full blown menu with burgers, salads, pizzas, fish, and more. Looking at this was a task on its own. I ended up getting the Veggie Burger since I am a huge fan of beets. The patty is not like a Boca Burger. It is not condense or have the texture of meat. It is made up of farro, a wheat grain, and the deep burgundy vegetable. After a few bites, I gave up on trying to eat it as a burger and just ate the contents between the bun. It just felt odd to eat all these carbs together. The farro was cooked well and I enjoyed its flavor. It would make for a good salad. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now comes the real reason to come to the Cheesecake Factory, it is all about their... brownies. I kid, the only reason why I still come back to this establishment is for their cheesecake. The Red Velvet is my go to dessert.

Another is the wide variety of menu items. Sure, there are several pages of variations on chicken, but there are also so many different meat preparations, salads, sandwiches, Asian offerings and tasty appetizers to fit the bill. A bread basket to start, and two pages of cheesecake variations to finish (key lime is #1!)...mmmm...<br&gt;<br&gt;I am a coffee snob, not so much (though a little) a chain snob, but even this is hard to find fault with at CF.

Since this has always been one of my favorite places to go, of course I had to argue with him. Determined to prove him wrong, I insisted that we go here for dinner.<br&gt;<br&gt;We went in, put our name down on the wait list, and went outside for a cigarette. Now this is a normal practice, and typically restaurant hosts will always check outside for the next table to be seated if nobody answers their call from inside, especially if the waiting area inside is full! They didn&amp;#39;t even try to look for us when we were literally standing just outside of the door (which we had also let the hostess know before stepping out), and it took a leaving customer to inform us that we were up for a table. We ended up having to sit outside because they sat somebody else at our table.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our waitress was friendly (which was the only pro of the night). I ordered a rare steak Diane and herb crusted salmon. When the food came out, my steak was COLD. Not even room temperature, but cold. When I informed our waitress, she had the audacity to tell me that in order for them to cook it rare, they could only throw it on the grill for a couple seconds which meant that it was normal for it to be cold. Are you seriously kidding me? I don&amp;#39;t ever eat anything BUT rare steak, and I have yet gone to a restaurant and been served a cold one. Furthermore, if you don&amp;#39;t know how the steak Diane at The Cheesecake Factory is, the steak is actually thinly sliced into little pieces, about three inches in diameter. So it doesn&amp;#39;t take much for the meat to get heated up. As a reference, I have ordered this dish before at several other Cheesecake Factories, and not once have I encountered this problem. <br&gt;<br&gt;At this point I was just bummed out, but my friend insisted on complaining to the manager, so that&amp;#39;s who we asked for. It was a good 15 minutes before anybody walked past us or any of the tables around. We had to asked for a manager twice before our waitress came back with my steak re-cooked. The manager lingered in the background behind her and they both left after she gave me my steak. At this point we just asked for the check and a to-go box since our appetites were gone. I didn&amp;#39;t even bother checking my steak to see if it was any good this time around.<br&gt;<br&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t bother mentioning, but my herb crusted salmon was exceptionally bland. I had to season the life into it with salt and pepper myself. At least it was decently cooked, and with how they treated my steak, I didn&amp;#39;t even want to complain about anything else. I don&amp;#39;t remember what my date had to eat, but it&amp;#39;s safe to say that we were just as impressed with his dish as we were with mine, which was not at all.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m a very easy-going and forgiving person, so for me the big issue isn&amp;#39;t necessarily the poor cooking, but the service and management (as I&amp;#39;ve seen other reviewers have pointed out). They should have just fixed the problem when it was presented, instead of making excuses. We were not being rude or unfriendly (in fact quite the opposite, despite of everything) and it&amp;#39;s not like I was asking for the meal to be comped or discounted. In addition, I&amp;#39;ve never seen worse management skills. The manager never bothered to introduce himself or ask us how we were doing, even though we had specifically asked for him. Everything was a huge hassle and they made me feel like I was someone who was super picky or asking too much.<br&gt;<br&gt;My friend is right in that The Cheesecake Factory is a relatively pricey place to eat and based on my experience at this location, it is definitely not worth it. Worst $50 of my life, which doesn&amp;#39;t even include tax and tip. It&amp;#39;s a good thing our waitress was at least friendly and smiled through the night, because her other service skills were quite lacking. I don&amp;#39;t even know how the manager was hired, because he showed no managerial skills whatsoever.

She finally appeared and delivering another tables food and one of us had to walk after her because she never even checked on us. <br&gt;<br&gt;She apologized for the mushrooms and said she&amp;#39;d have another one sent right out and also said she&amp;#39;d bring the dressing right back, &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;ll be right back with your balsamic&amp;#34; however, I previously had asked for ranch. <br&gt;<br&gt;It took another 10-15 minutes for someone to tell us that the sandwich was almost done. It was a manager and I asked for it to be packaged to-go because everyone was already done eating. We told him about the utter lack of service and he apologized and offered to buy us desert, we accepted. Melissa came back with the sandwich packaged to-go and asked what kind of deserts we&amp;#39;d like, we told her and requested no whipped cream be put on the cheesecake. <br&gt;<br&gt;She said she&amp;#39;d get them packaged up for us and left the bill. The manager was kind enough to comp the meal but only comped one of the slices of cheesecake after he offered to buy it for us. <br&gt;<br&gt;We paid the bill and Melissa returned with our cheesecakes, of course one had whipped cream.

One of the mess ups out of many was burned French fries. At an establishment like this I expect high standards. First off the cook was a jerk for even putting it out there to be served. Second the waitress failed by bringing it to us after clearly seeing that it was burned. We had to tell her they were burned (it was obvious) and she didn&amp;#39;t even apologize or seem sympathetic she just said ok i&amp;#39;ll get you another one, in a quick fast tone. If you alter a dish, they will bring it to you wrong. And i&amp;#39;m not talking about an extreme alteration. I&amp;#39;m talking about asking for a different type of pasta vs. the one it comes with. If they mess up your dish it will come back more screwed up as if to punish you for having the audacity to correct the mistake. Take out is always a guarantee mess up and they always give you less food when you do take out vs. when you sit inside. I am speaking from 3 years of experience with this place. If you can, go to the one in Summerlin they are much better and more on target. its really sad that such an awesome establishment is screwed up and nothing is done to rectify it.

There is something for everyone here and you will not be disappointed with the taste of your food, when made properly. I know a lot of flack is given to this place for the high fat and calorie content. I really don&amp;#39;t think that people are looking at it from the proper perspective. You need to know they give you huge portions here. The fat and calorie content is based on the huge plate of food you receive. This place is giving you all this food with the intent of being able to have the consumer bring some home for later. You cant possible think that you are supposed to eat all that food in one sitting. The food you get on your plate is way more then what you would get on the appetizer plate. Appetizers are meant to serve 2-4 people and your entr\u00e9e contains more food then that. So I will leave you with that food for thought ;). If you eat the proper portion its really not that bad in fat and calories. Have you ever seen the fat and calories in a marie calendars frozen meal at the grocery store?!

So they told us it&amp;#39;ll be a hour wait which we were fine with. An hour past we still waited 2 hours are creeping by so we ask if our table was ready, no not yet. Still waiting and now 5 kids are getting inpatient and crying they are hungry. Now Im getting upset and whats taking so long to get a table. It seem as if they didn&amp;#39;t care I had to ask for a manager to get anything done. The manager did try to make the situation better by comp some food but the damage was done for a 2 hrs and so wait. I with to order a cheesecake for my mother and some man that work there made a comment that I had to pay for that. I just brush it off and reply I know that.

I ordered the gluten free skinny ceasar salad. I was happy they had an option for me. I received my salad and 3 bites in I found a BUG in my salad. I was shocked and disgusted. The waiter was shocked as well and took my salad. About 5 minutes later the manager came over and gave me a fake smile and apology that was very procedural. She offered me something else but why on earth would I want anything else from this place. I am very limited as to what I eat and this was one of the only options for me. I sure didn&amp;#39;t want another salad with BUGS in it. Yes, I get it- it&amp;#39;s lettuce and bugs like lettuce but they should be washing their lettuce more thoroughly to avoid this disgusting situation. I had to sit the rest of the meal while others in the party ate their meals which were not salad. As a person in customer service, the manager did not go out of her way to rectify the situation. She could have offered a discount on the rest of the bill. She took the salad off the bill but of course she would, I did not eat it and this was their fault. When we left the same manager was standing near the exit and she turned her back when she saw us leaving. Did not say another word to us. This is horrible customer service at it&amp;#39;s finest. I will not ever go back to this place and urge others to be aware of the BUGS in the salad. To all the restaurants out there, when it is your fault someone&amp;#39;s meal goes terribly wrong it is your responsibility to make things right. Had they discounted the rest of the bill or heck even offered to cover the bill themselves maybe I wouldn&amp;#39;t have written this review!
