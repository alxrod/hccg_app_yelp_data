We arrived just before 5:30 and we waited about an hour to be seated. My husband and I had a $25 gift card to spend, so we spent a good bit of our wait going over the lengthy menu and deciding what to order without going too much over that.<br&gt;<br&gt;In the end, we decided to get a couple of appetizers and split a piece of cheesecake. We ordered the Dynamite Shrimp, which is tempura breaded shrimp with a side of what the menu describes as &amp;#34;our spicy Dynamite sauce.&amp;#34; The shrimp was absolutely delicious. The sauce was also very good, but I would not have described it as spicy.<br&gt;<br&gt;The other appetizer we ordered was the Factory Nachos, which comes with cheese, guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, jalape\u00f1os, and green onion. The chips were on the thick side and very crispy, so they held up well to the cheese and other items on the nachos. This was a delicious plate of nachos, and it included a big &amp;#39;ol dollop of sour cream, but sadly they really skimped on the guacamole, pico de gallo, and other items. At almost $13 for a dish with no meat, I really didn&amp;#39;t feel like we got what we paid for. It was especially disappointing because the guac and pico were so doggone good.<br&gt;<br&gt;Lastly, the strawberry cheesecake. The strawberries on ours were plump and perfectly ripe and included a nice sauce. As for the cheesecake itself, I have always felt that the cheesecake here is fine, but quite a bit dryer than some I&amp;#39;ve had at other places that was better. As you would expect from their name, they do have a wide variety of different cheesecakes.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, good food and friendly service, but I will say I agree with some of the other reviewers who have said it&amp;#39;s overpriced. I certainly appreciate receiving the gift card someone gave us, but I don&amp;#39;t know that I would come here without one and pay full price.", "rating": 3, "date": "1/5/2019"}, {"text": "Went with my family for my birthday, the hosted asked us to wait outside of the restaurant because we didn&amp;#39;t have masks.

I have been a customer of Cheesecake Factory be for years. This was the worst location I&amp;#39;ve visited in North America! When I arrived I was read my rights about wearing a mask. The manager seated me near a very busy, loud, noisy location which I thought was odd. Of course Cheesecake Factory is loud but this particular area is where servers and bar hops work out of. The bread was cold when it arrived. I was not given straws for the drinks I ordered. Of course I sent asked for straws and I sent the bread back to the kitchen. There was a very hostile and over intrusive Caucasian female manager who constantly cane to my table and harassed me about mundane things. I believe she might have thought she was being helpful but she was not. It was harassment. I then proceeded to the bar while waiting for my food to arrive (which is my custom). The same manager came to the bar and again lectured me about rules, wearing a mask (I was wearing one the entire time) and she told me I could not order at the bar. I then proceeded to the restroom and she told me GOOD NIGHT! My food had not arrived so again, I struggled her rude and unwelcoming behavior off. When I returned my table had been cleared off and the manager stated she thought I was leaving. First, I had not paid my bill yet and I was waiting for a drink at the bar. I ordered the Fillet Mignon Entree and the steak was dry, unseasoned and the vegetables and mashed potatoes were not like any of the other locations. The food was awful and I was entirely disappointed. I confronted the female manager about her unwelcoming, rude and obnoxious behavior and she gave me one excuse after another but insisted that I was not a problem and she had no issues with me. Finally, a make manager came to my attention and asked if everything was okay. I td him about my experience and then I requested my bill. The manager had removed some items from my bill. I did not request this and I requested he put them back on the bill. Instead of him doing this he just printed out a duplicate copy of the original bill with all of my charges so as to mislead me to believe he charged me. I checked my bank account orior to leaving and behold it was the discounted charge that I objected to originally. I confronted him and he was embarrassed that I caught him. The entire experience was TERRIBLE, AWFUL and UNWELCOMING! I will return to this location but I will not be treated this way again.

We know this is no fault of our server. A manager comes over and apologizes and explains to us that he thinks it was a single corn silk. I am all about benefit of the doubt, but why would we have a single 1 in. cornsilk on our dish of lettuce wraps that does not involve corn? <br&gt;<br&gt;My friend orders the pork chop and subs the mashed potatoes for roasted broccoli. I ordered the carbonara pasta with red pepper flakes. Food comes out and my friend receives mashed potatoes. We kindly told the food runner that she had broccoli. He returns with steamed broccoli.

That&amp;#39;s FIVE people we had to ask because of the absence of our server. <br&gt;<br&gt;The second round of lettuce wraps is out--this time with no sauce. I found this ironic because when our first round of lettuce wraps with a single one inch corn silk came out, our server scoffed at it and noted that the plating was wrong. How can you notice that, but not notice that our second round had zero out of three sauces on it? Overall we had poor service. We are usually both understanding as we both work in high volume bars as well. We were disappointed in the poor service, the excuses, and were overall surprised that we had to pay for the lettuce wraps (missing all the sauces) that didn&amp;#39;t come out until after our meal.

They should call this place The Sugar Factory<br&gt;<br&gt;I had dinner at a Japanese restaurant in the Polaris mall food court where I got a huge portion of food at a great price, I decided to come here for dessert. All I could taste in the two different cheesecakes I ordered were just huge amounts of sugar. The pieces of cheesecake I ordered were caramel pecan and some kind of truffle, they&amp;#39;re supposed to be different from each other but tasted nearly exactly the same and each layer I bit into had hardly any difference in taste besides just tasting like different textures of sugar. I could hear my kidneys and liver shrieking in pain because of the sugar overload from each bite.<br&gt;<br&gt;This stuff is EXPENSIVE too! Totally not worth the money. they charge a fortune for just one piece of cheesecake, if it tasted amazing I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind that, when I go to a grocery store though and buy a mass-produced piece of cheesecake for 1/5 of the cost it should NOT taste better than the one that costs a fortune that i ordered from this restaurant. One of the bakery staff had an attitude with me when I tried ordering too. I was standing in front of the bakery where there were two or three people working on the other side and I waited for someone to ask me if I needed help, I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if this where I was supposed to order.
