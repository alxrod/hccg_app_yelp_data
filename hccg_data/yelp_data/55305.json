It was a beautiful day and, despite the flies, we enjoyed the weather.<br&gt;<br&gt;Service was verrry slow. I asked the waitress if she was new after seeing the table next to us return food and drinks twice AND the fact that she admitted to our table she had forgotten to put our meal order in. Nope. She wasn&amp;#39;t new. Hmmm. We waited well over an hour for our food. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food arrived. My husband ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken. Chicken was more breading than chicken so he was pretty disappointed about that. My daughter ordered the Steak Medallions, son got rotini, and I got the Boneless Lemon Herb Chicken. <br&gt;<br&gt;The waiter spilled most of the lemon herb sauce on the floor when he brought our food over. I had 2 pieces of chicken...both under a layer of rubbery skin. I removed the skin and ate a tiny portion of the chicken on one half because the other half of my &amp;#34;boneless&amp;#34; chicken contained a large bone. Looked like a leg bone. <br&gt;<br&gt;I picked away at the chicken, which was rubbery, and filled up on the mashed potatoes and carrots. When the waitress returned (finally) to put leftovers in containers, I mentioned the bone. No big deal to her, I guess. She just looked at me, then took my plate to pack it. <br&gt;<br&gt;I brought my chicken and leftovers home to eat and was absolutely disgusted the next day when I pulled off the top layer of rubbery skin to find who the heck knows what underneath. It looked like the stuff I cut off my chicken and give it to the dog because it&amp;#39;s unidentifiable and too disgusting to eat. I showed my family and picked up one end by the fork and a long 7-8&amp;#34; connected glob of garbage &amp;#34;chicken&amp;#34; dangled from the fork to my plate. Yes, of course I took pictures. <br&gt;<br&gt;I also immediately contacted The Cheesecake Factory with NO response. GREAT customer service, right?<br&gt;<br&gt;Oh yes...and my daughter got sick about 6 hours after we ate at The Cheesecake Factory and missed a day of work the next day.

I find it funny/odd that they serve ice water in a plastic beer mug seeing how fanny the restaurant looked. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food:<br&gt; <br&gt;Fried Calamari ($12.95)- Perfectly battered and seasoned. The tartar sauce and the shrimp cocktail was delicious. I took turn dipping both sauce cause I couldn&amp;#39;t decide which one I liked more. <br&gt;<br&gt;Shrimp &amp;amp; Chicken Gumbo ($17.95)- The sauce wasn&amp;#39;t as thick as I would have liked it to be and the Cajun broth needs to be spicier. But, it was still very good. The shrimp and chicken was cooked perfectly and the parsley sprinkled over the bowl was a nice touch. \u00a0<br&gt;<br&gt;Chargrilled Bone-in New York Steak ($19.95)- I ordered the steak medium rare and it came out perfectly. The steak was juicy and tender however it was a bit over seasoned. The mash potato was delicious with a great butter taste.<br&gt;<br&gt;Additional thoughts - I personally had a great time and the food was delicious. I did however felt that the service needed to be more professional.

Offered us an apology, and to buy the burger that was most expensive. For 1.5 hour wait for food and shitty service my only tip to them was better customer service training. Long story longer, we will not be returning.", "rating": 1, "date": "1/15/2018"}, {"text": "Was very excited for a night out with my fianc\u00e9. We attempted to make reservations and were informed that it was a first come first serve basis we arrived around 6:20 PM and were told there was a 20 minute wait we were not seated until around 7 PM our waitress came out and tried to upsell us on many appetizers which we weren&amp;#39;t interested in since we waited 40 minutes for our food I then ordered the fettuccine Alfredo blackened and my fianc\u00e9 order the New York strip well done with extra seasoning our food arrive roughly 20 to 30 minutes later then the appetizers we ordered arrived after the entr\u00e9es my fianc\u00e9&amp;#39;s New York strip was not well done it was very pink his french friesWe&amp;#39;re not fresh and we had to send them back the waitress came back within two minutes with a fresh order of fries which were just as old as the previous order my fianc\u00e9 then asked the waitress to Touch the french fries to see if they were hat which she did she then apologized and said that her manager told her to bring us those fries because they were fresh we waited for another 5 to 10 minutes before the order Arrived at this point I shared myEntr\u00e9e with my fianc\u00e9 because his meal was not properly prepared we then found on the bottom of my plate was filled with butter I thought Alfredo sauce was more of a cream-based sauce our waitress I disappeared by this time so instead of informing her it was 8:25pm by now \u00a0we just asked for the check and left. I still tipped 20% because she seems overworked and flustered. Can&amp;#39;t say I will revisit this location.", "rating": 2, "date": "4/22/2018"}, {"text": "I went with a group of girlfriends to celebrate some birthdays. We knew we had a big group on a Friday (and they wouldn&amp;#39;t take reservations!) so we arrived early, thinking we&amp;#39;d chat and have a drink while we wait. We were told 30-45 minutes. We checked in after an hour (weren&amp;#39;t updated) and were told we would be seated soon. Sure, there was a lingering party (we understood). They comped a few apps (great)! But then we found a small table at the bar (many of us standing), made it clear to the manager we still wanted our table then it was given away. Again, we&amp;#39;re a big party so can&amp;#39;t just find another one. We waited a full 2 hours before being sat (and when I suggested to the manager &amp;#34;I think we need drinks now&amp;#34; she made it sound as if they&amp;#39;d be on the house.) this did not happen. Then it took them at least 30 minutes to settle our checks! All in all we were there for 4 hours for a few apps, drinks and a to-go dessert (which did taste good), and I still paid (even with some comped apps) what I would have at a much nicer restaurant. NOT good customer service. Cheesecake Factory, actually covering our drinks that you said you would have may have earned you back a few customers and wouldn&amp;#39;t have cost you much. A shame.", "rating": 1, "date": "12/1/2017"}]}
