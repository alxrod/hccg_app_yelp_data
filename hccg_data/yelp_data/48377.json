They apologized gave us free desert and a gift card for a future visit.<br&gt;<br&gt;Well today I figured I&amp;#39;d used the gift card on a carryout order, a classic burger MEDIUM to go, please look at the picture and be the judge. Looks well done to me, definitely not medium. They said it would be 20 minutes. Order placed at 5:48 pm. At 6:10 I asked about my order they said it would be 8 more minutes. At 6:25 they said it should be ready soon they had to make a fresh one they were just waiting on the burger. I sarcastically said &amp;#34;all I ordered was a burger that only takes 3 minutes to cook each side to reach a medium temperature what&amp;#39;s the hold up?&amp;#34; The girl explained someone accidentally took mine out the window and they&amp;#39;re remaking it. I&amp;#39;m pretty PO&amp;#39;d right now because it can only get worse from here. At 6:38 exactly 50 minutes after I placed the order she hands me my bag, I walked to the car opened it up the burger was well done with NO CONDIMENTS. I took a couple of bites and tossed that dry AZZ hockey puck out the window.

My girlfriends weren&amp;#39;t scheduled to get there for another forty minutes so I thought I&amp;#39;d enjoy some happy hour refreshments at the bar. The rail had two couples, one woman who was dining solo, and myself - by no means busy. It still took me several minutes to get greeted with an unenthusiastic&amp;#34;hi.&amp;#34; Awesome. Great start - searching for service from an inattentive bartender. I ordered a Skinny Margarita and the Tex Mex Egg Rolls. Both were delicious. I finished my margarita and waited (no joke, I looked at my watch) for ten minutes before I had to basically yell at the bartender for another drink. I ordered a Hendrix martini on the rocks. He gave it to me up. I got attitude when I asked him for it on the rocks once more. My party was trickling in at that moment so I decided to cash out so I could tip him instead of asking for everything to get transferred to the table (we had snagged some high tops in the bar area.) I thought, &amp;#34;what the heck maybe he&amp;#39;s just having a rough day,&amp;#34; so I tipped him $6 on $27 and moved. HOWEVER. Two hours later when my girlfriends and I were wrapping up our food to go, a server approached me with the tab I had ALREADY PAID FOR and told me the bartender requested I paid. What? You gave me horrible service and you want me to pay my tab, twice? That is unacceptable. I walked over to the bar and told him I had already paid and I got a reluctant &amp;#34;yeah sure.&amp;#34; Bro it&amp;#39;s not my fault you can&amp;#39;t close out your checks when there is literally NO ONE at the bar.

I gave her ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to act the way she did. <br&gt;<br&gt;My boyfriend and I went very early in the day (to avoid the rush) before there was a wait, and we were seated immediately. It was as soon as we got sat that things started to get bad. Our waitress (HER NAME WAS JAZMINE) greeted the table next to us and didn&amp;#39;t get around to greeting us until at least 15 minutes later. It usually doesn&amp;#39;t take that long to get greeted, but again we understood that it was a holiday. It starts getting worse from here. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our drinks took AT LEAST 30 minutes, if not more (I think she forgot to ring them in). We ordered the fried cheese appetizer at the SAME time as our drinks. The waitress came back BEFORE our drinks were out (because they had taken THAT long) to take our order? The fried cheese appetizer NEVER came out. When our meals finally came out we realized we weren&amp;#39;t getting our appetizer, and on top of that the waitress never came back to get us more drinks, sauce, check on us etc. When she finally did come back we were done eating, and I kindly asked for a box. SHE NEVER GAVE ME A BOX. She came back again, and I asked for a box AGAIN. She swiftly picked up my plate, and took my food to the back, boxed it up for me and gave it back. Now I normally wouldn&amp;#39;t mind this at all, but considering the circumstances and how extremely long it took her to box up my food, I was absolutely positive that she had done something to my food. <br&gt;<br&gt;At this point, not only had my boyfriend and I waited an obnoxious amount of time, not gotten our appetizer, another drink, a side of sauce, OR a box, I also couldn&amp;#39;t eat my leftovers that I paid top price for! Because I knew I could no longer eat my leftovers, I decided to order Cheesecake. My boyfriend ordered his to go, and I ordered mine for here because at this point I was seriously starting to get hungry again! That was a mistake on my part because 30 minutes later, I flagged the waitress down and asked for my cheesecake to-go because we had been there for SO long at this point. She agreed and another 15 minutes later she brought the cheesecake out and mine was NOT to-go. At this point we had already paid our bill and tipped 20% (regardless of the terrible service), so when I kindly asked for a box because we just wanted to leave, she said okay, walked away and NEVER CAME BACK. We finally had to ask another server for a box and this server was able to take care of three other tables first and still get me a box before our terrible waitress did.

We get it and take a bite and wow. It sucked bad! It tasted old... the crust had absolutely no crunch to it. It was basically wet. We were so disappointed we left like 75%-80% untouched. He came back and i shared my disappointment. As a server i would have taken the plate to the manager and asked to either refund or offer another piece! He said &amp;#34;better luck next time&amp;#34; after he said &amp;#34;are you guys too disappointed to take it home?&amp;#34; He could care less. But for the price that you are paying for one slice of cheesecake (and those drinks) there should be better service. But i lost the bet!

You could tell that it was in deep freeze, because it was even sweaty from de-thawing but still had so much that a mountain of freezerburn-frost still remained. The cheesecake was very dry and crumbly and it wasn&amp;#39;t even that chocolaty. It was hard, dry, and tasted like dust. The other 2 cheesecakes were okay, but nothing special. They didn&amp;#39;t look nearly as good as the pictures as they varied with toppings. They were significantly less freezer burnt, but still had that essence to them.

We ordered:<br&gt;<br&gt;1. the avocado eggrolls, which probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be so great without the sweet sauce that comes with it.<br&gt;2. chicken and biscuits; chicken and veggies (carrots, peas, and mushrooms) were delicious but the biscuit could have been fresher.<br&gt;3. fried shrimp platter with french fries and coleslaw; the fried shrimp tasted just salty on their own, not much flavor; but at least they weren&amp;#39;t overcooked.<br&gt;<br&gt;Of course, their desserts are great. Service was friendly and attentive.

I used to love Cheesecake Factory when we traveled outside of Michigan, but started hating it because of the endless menu and huge portions. But my experience today was pretty nice. We had calamari and the French country salad for an appetizer. The calamari was hot, crispy, and not too salty and was fried in clean oil. The salad was alright nothing too special. I ordered it for the beets but the beets were underdone for my taste. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered a lunch portion of spaghetti and meatballs, but as expected it was still a huge portion. It was very delicious. The noodles were perfectly al dente, the sauce had a strong basil flavor, and the meatballs were meaty and soft without being mealy. The only thing is that it needed a little bit more sauce. The fried basil garnish was a nice touch. Also everything was hot as food should be. <br&gt;<br&gt;The jambalaya Cajun pasta was a little disappointing. Very spicy, but that was about the only flavor it had. The grilled steak medallions on the &amp;#34;skinnylicious&amp;#34; menu was the only thing we ordered that was a reasonable portion size. I purposefully never order low fat, low carb, lighter fare options based on the concern that the food will lack flavor, but it seems that the lighter fare menu here is just slightly lower fat, but mainly smaller portions. Which is wonderful. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our server did a nice job as well. Polite and attentive. However I didn&amp;#39;t like that we had to ask for bread instead of it just being provided. But don&amp;#39;t hesitate to ask for it. The brown bread they have doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be a rye bread, but it has a sweet chocolate flavor, which sounds weird but I had nearly 3 pieces, with butter oops... <br&gt;<br&gt;Oh also we shared a tiramisu cheesecake which was so so good.

It was like a Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon around 3pm. There was little to no wait. Wait staff did a good job. Sat in a half booth and was comfy too. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food was really quite delish. My dad had the steak Diane and shrimp scampi combo, my mom had the Jamaican black pepper shrimp and I went with the herb crusted salmon. All were happy and huge, none were dietician friendly. I think very few things on the menu are to be frank. This doesn&amp;#39;t bother me a bit, if you are trying to eat anywhere near healthy it may bother you. Me, well I figure they state they are a cheesecake place so I am not expecting health food.<br&gt;<br&gt;I love the sinful nature of the salmon here, the lemon sauce is creamy and evil, a pure butter base. This rich sauce is perfect with the slightly crisped salmon, calorie bomb mashed potatoes and tender crisp asparagus. I also loved my mom&amp;#39;s shrimp because of the black beans, mango salsa and fried plantains. They all worked together well with the kick of the shrimp. My dad&amp;#39;s scampi was tasty but I am not hugely into steak Diane. It is a good rendition if you like it though.<br&gt;<br&gt;I will get a salad next time because the portions were so generous I couldn&amp;#39;t order a dessert. I took a bite of my mom&amp;#39;s carrot cake and meh. Skip it. I&amp;#39;m betting the carrot cheesecake is better.

In our most recent visit, I ordered a combination plate of the Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira with mashed potatoes. It was a lot of food and tasted great. I ordered the steak medium and had 3 pieces of steak on my plate. There were 2 cooked medium and 1 cooked medium-rare. Our waiter, Michael, took the one piece and had it cooked a bit longer so I could eat while my meal was hot. He was awesome! Attentive, friendly, and offered some great recommendations for both our meals and cheesecake.

And, after the meal, he counted the money directly on the table which was very odd. <br&gt;<br&gt;The WORST part of my last experience happened after I left the restaurant.

It was about 1&amp;#34;X1/2&amp;#34; and it was sharp. It must have chipped off of something. I was frustrated and immediately called the restaurant. The manager was not helpful.

As if giving the customer a courtesy credit on their bill for dropping the ball meant some kind of hit to their paychecks. I can&amp;#39;t figure out why on two recent occasions, two distinct managers were not very responsive to our concerns and offered nothing more than a half-hearted apology as if our legitimate complaints were nothing.<br&gt;<br&gt;On second most recent visit, my son and his girlfriend arrived and sat down about 20 minutes before we arrived. Upon sitting down, I asked my son about bread. He said they told him they were out of bread and would be up. Another 20 minutes and still no bread. The server finally showed up to take our orders, I inquired. He said it was in the oven and coming soon. His tone and attitude was less than enthusiastic. I asked how much longer. His answer: I&amp;#39;ll bring it out as soon as it was ready&amp;#34;. I mentioned that it had been 45 minutes since we arrived, -how difficult was it for a restaurant like CF to have bread readily available? \u00a0 Again, he gave a very condescending response, so I asked that he find a manager and an alternate server with a better attitude. \u00a0He left the table, and we soon had another server with a much better attitude. \u00a0A manager later came by, we explained the situation, and our frustration. We got a half-hearted apology and lame explanation about the bread with little or no desire to make up for the delay in delivering bread to our table or for the attitude of the server. \u00a0Not even an offer for dessert on the house--not that it was a requirement, but it would have helped.<br&gt;<br&gt;Fast forward a month later, we went back for dessert at 9:45pm after waiting 45 minutes for a table. Two slices of Cheesecake was all we ordered, It wasn&amp;#39;t until 10:30pm that we got our desserts. At 10:10, we asked the server, and she said yes, it takes 15 minutes on average to get dessert, and she went to check on them. She disappeared for more than 20 minutes when the desserts finally showed up at our table at 10:30, a full 45 minutes after our arrival. A manager finally came around the table who said that she had heard that we had a concern about a 15 minute time frame to receive desserts. She said this is normal. When I said it had taken 45 minutes, she said, &amp;#34;Oh, I heard it was only 15 minutes. I suggested she check to see when our order had been entered into the system to resolve this discrepancy. She offered us a complimentary coffee or beverage (at 10:30pm) if we liked and we declined.

I liked the large crispy tortilla chip at the bottom that added extra crunch. The eggplant parmesan was rich and tasty, and my Bacon-Bacon burger was nommy!

The chefs are not well trained at this location, and it&amp;#39;s become just a restaurant with the Cheesecake Factory name. If there was another Cheesecake Factory nobody would even come to this location. My fianc\u00e9e and I have eaten Cheesecake Factory in several other states and this one is by far the worst. If you thought you could never have a bad meal at Cheesecake Factory come to this location. Anytime we give it another chance (because other Cheesecake factory&amp;#39;s are great) we are disappointed. We have had pasta that wasn&amp;#39;t drained, food that wasn&amp;#39;t seasoned, food that has been burnt, and the service is nearly always mediocre to bad. Last night was the final straw though. My fianc\u00e9e and I went for Valentines Day, to be honest we were hesitant to even come to Cheesecake Factory in the first place, but decided to give it another try. HUGE mistake! We waited an hour and a half for a table, which wasn&amp;#39;t a problem because it&amp;#39;s Valentines Day and we were expecting that. However after our buzzer went off we handed it to the hostess and then we were still waiting, as we are waiting we see an angry customer come up, and the hostess switched the receipt and gives someone else our table. We went up to the hostess and sure enough it was confirmed that our table was given away by a gentleman named Martez. The other employees near by asked him why he gave up the table and they all just looked confused but all we got was a half assed apology. We asked to speak to a manager, and Martez didn&amp;#39;t want to get us one but finally did after we told him we are going to speak to a manager. Finally she comes over and finds a place to seat us and barely wants to give us an apology. My fianc\u00e9e asked the manager Catherine if she would do something about it (a complimentary slice of cheesecake or an appetizer would have been fine) she says no and that she seated us right away (she didn&amp;#39;t) we waited 20 minutes after the buzzer went off to be seated. When she finally came over yes we were seated. By then it was 10:00 am. We were suppose to be seated at 9:40 pm when the buzzer went off. I know because I checked my phone. I asked the manager before she left if she was going to confront Martez about the situation. She said she would, but it was obviously forced if I had to ask.My fianc\u00e9e said to me she didn&amp;#39;t want to stay after experiencing that service and by this time it was clear they were looking to rush people out. When I went up to the front desk and let them know we were leaving. The manager just said okay and was giving another half assed talk to the hostess Martez just to try and look good. It was obvious they wanted us to leave because of the time and for that reason we will never go to this location again as long as Catherine is the manager. Quite possibly some of the worst customer service we have ever experienced. This place wouldn&amp;#39;t even get busy if people here at Cheesecake Factory in another state, because what you are getting is not quality food or service. The 1800 number will be notified of this situation. Just all around horrible service and management, and the food isn&amp;#39;t even worth it.

I&amp;#39;m just comparing this to any other restaurant I&amp;#39;d eat at. <br&gt;<br&gt;When it comes down to it, this place is really weird. Some things are great but most things are just... barely okay. \u00a0When you walk in the first thing you see are high ceiling and some strange decor. Not sure who the interior decorator was, but he had some weird taste. But whatever, this is about food not color schemes. <br&gt;<br&gt;First off, I came in on Wednesday at 3pm and there was told a half hour wait. I&amp;#39;m not sure why. I saw plenty empty tables. I didn&amp;#39;t want to wait, I immediately knew it wasn&amp;#39;t going to be worth it. My company insisted on at least trying it, so I obliged. <br&gt;<br&gt;Waited 20 minutes, still not great and I assume they just overshoot the time anyways so people will feel better getting a table sooner-than-expected. A man set us down at a small two-person table along a very long bench. Very cramped. Not a lot of moving around room and there are people about 1-2 feet away from you. You can hear their conversation, and they can hear yours.<br&gt;<br&gt;Waiter took 3-4 minutes to arrive with water and take our drink orders. Water is good for me. My company ordered something, took another 3 minutes for that to arrive. <br&gt;Meanwhile, we&amp;#39;re fronted with an absolutely staggeringly huge menu. It&amp;#39;s 21 pages. It has advertisements in the menu. Advertisements. In. A. Menu. This is the first time I ever saw ads in a menu and was blown away. I don&amp;#39;t understand.<br&gt;<br&gt;Really, the menu is just too big. It has 5 pages of specialties. This place specializes in over 30 items of stuff ranging from Chinese to Mongolian to American to French? They call their burgers glamburgers. I had a chuckle at that. But seriously, 21 pages of items. I&amp;#39;m an indecisive person. It took to me forever to get a even basic picture of what they serve. Maybe some people like a menu consisting of a minimum of 200 items. I don&amp;#39;t. I can&amp;#39;t imagine a chef being able to perfect over 200 items in a chain restaurant. This isn&amp;#39;t a Michelin starred restaurant. <br&gt;<br&gt;Meat sounded good, so I decided on a burger since I doubted the 3pm Wednesday chef could cook an excellent steak (prime fillet cost $30). Steak is just one of those things for me that if I&amp;#39;m going to have I&amp;#39;d like it to be awesome. Call me smug, but an Outback steak just doesn&amp;#39;t cut it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Anyways, I had the Kobe Burger. Food arrive in a quick fashion. During this time, our waiter has yet to be seen since they took our order, which was about 15 minutes ago. They did not bring our food, someone else did. Another 5 minutes went by until they appeared, but only to say &amp;#34;Enjoy your food&amp;#34; and then to run off. Didn&amp;#39;t leave any room to ask for something. I wasn&amp;#39;t served any condiments with my burger or fries or offered any. So, after not seeing her for the past 20 minutes, I kind of shrugged and decided to eat it anyways. <br&gt;<br&gt;Surprisingly, the Kobe Burger tasted pretty good. I ordered medium rare, received medium, but it tasted good. Mind you, it wasn&amp;#39;t stunning, but I was happy with it. The fries were also surprisingly good.<br&gt;<br&gt;So, despite everything, I&amp;#39;d say the food is pretty good.<br&gt;<br&gt;However, again, our waiter did not appear for another 10 minutes. They came by to serve another table across from us, did not look our way. Came by another 5 minutes but to ask that same table if everything was okay. I could hear her. She didn&amp;#39;t look our way. Finished our meals, glasses empty. Waited another 5 minutes for the check. Received the check, needed it spit (was not asked if together or separate, not something I immediately think about). Took another 2 minutes to receive that. Overall, wasted a lot of time. I&amp;#39;m beginning to understand why the wait is so long. <br&gt;<br&gt;-- Summary --<br&gt;<br&gt;This place is okay. Not great. Comparatively, there are a lot better places, CPK being one of them across the corridor. <br&gt;<br&gt;Seating for two people is extremely cramped and you can hear other peoples conversations who are seated right next to you about 2 feet away. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food is good. For the price, I&amp;#39;d say value is pretty good.<br&gt;<br&gt;Service is terrible. The waitress did not ask if we needed anything during the meal because they did not show up during the meal. Glasses were not refilled during the entire time we were there. They were, however, over by us multiple times but simply ignoring us or did not think about us. Either way, not good.<br&gt;<br&gt;Wait is unwarranted. If wait staff didn&amp;#39;t waste time with checks and not spending 10 minutes to bring the check, and then it needing to be separated (why don&amp;#39;t you ask?). I saw it took about 15 minutes to empty and clean the table that was empty next to us when we got there. That no doubt is a big reason why turnaround and seating is so slow. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, wait isn&amp;#39;t worth it. Food is okay, service is terrible.

Processed Cheese that didn&amp;#39;t taste like anything, and soaked through Nachos is what we got. Not overly impressed.<br&gt;<br&gt;Entrees: my husband and one of our friends had the Imperial chicken and SHRIMP, but the kitchen staff apparently forgot to put even a single piece of shrimp in there. They ate it anyway, because at that point we had waited for our food for 40 minutes already (and for a table for about 40 minutes as well). I ordered the Steak Tips with Mashed Potatoes off of the skinny menu (because earlier Yelp reviews scared me, mentioning the high calorie content of the regular menu;)). The steak was drenched in salt (and I am not a picky eater, neither a person who cares about their sodium intake), and the asparagus tasted moldy. I complained and had the waiter bring me a completely unsalted version of the steak tips. It took 30 minutes until I received it (and the others were already done eating). This second attempt was less salty, but had the consistency of a shoe sole (veeeeery chewy). I ate it anyway (at least the mashed potatoes), because at this point it was 8:50pm (ish) already. Apparently that is what you get for trying to eat healthier ;) stupid me!<br&gt;<br&gt;- Service (1.0)<br&gt;<br&gt;We (a party of 5) came in at 7pm and they told us we would have a waiting time of 55 minutes. We kind of expected that and went to the bar to grab an appetizer and a drink. (at this point I should mention that one of our friends is pregnant and cannot eat certain foods, such as not pasteurized cheeses). We ordered the Nachos with cheese and asked our waitress what kind of cheese it is, to make sure our friend could eat it, too. The waitress just looked at us and said &amp;#34;well, it&amp;#39;s melted and shredded cheese&amp;#34;. After that we asked again what KIND of cheese it is, and she just went on explaining that it is a melted cheese blend. She obviously had no idea, but did not consider asking the kitchen staff as well. <br&gt;<br&gt;When our buzzer went off, my husband and I went to check out the table, while our friends cashed out at the bar. The lady responsible for seating the customers led us to a table for 2, which obviously was not big enough. She apologized and had the staff put together two small tables, which was still way too small and barely fit all our plates (the high tops at the bar were bigger than this table).<br&gt;<br&gt;As for our entrees: my husband ordered Bang Bang Chicken, but they didn&amp;#39;t have that anymore, so he switched to the Imperial Chicken and Shrimp, but asked the waiter if he could get grilled chicken instead of breaded chicken. The waiter asked in the kitchen and came back explaining &amp;#34;we can do it, but it will probably take away from the taste. When we use breading, we bread the chicken. When we don&amp;#39;t bread it, I have no idea if it is still as good. You will have to order it at your own risk&amp;#34; (great statement, right?:P).<br&gt;<br&gt;- Speed (2.0)<br&gt;<br&gt;as mentioned before it took about 40 minutes until we got our entrees (and we didn&amp;#39;t order fancy stuff), and an additional 30 minutes for my second try with the steak tips.<br&gt;<br&gt;Bottom line: Probably good food if it were a bar, but I would have expected more from the Cheesecake Factory.

I was quite pumped. We arrived and the wait was quoted as 2-2.5 hours. No problem, the place is attached to a mall how bad can that be. So the hostess told me to come back an hour later for a pager. So I did and received my pager. I asked how far the pager works and she stated down the hall to the information desk. Really? So that means I was confined to this hallway for the next 1-1.5 hours?!?!?! With our technology these days I feel like there could be a better system so people could at least walk around the mall and when a party was about 30 minutes from being sat maybe they could send a text or something to return for a pager. It would be much more enticing to stay. <br&gt;<br&gt;However I&amp;#39;ve wanted to try this newest Factory location for a while and being in the company of good friends made the wait easier. We waited the full 2.5 hours if not about 15 minutes more. Our service was ok. It was obvious our waitress was busy as some things took a little long but that&amp;#39;s to be understood.<br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered the polenta fries to start. We debated getting two for the table but decided just for one, but our waitress must have misunderstood as the food runner brought two orders. When we told her we only wanted one she started arguing with us stating that the check definitely said 2 and that we definitely wanted 2 orders. Um what? Ok. So we told her we debated getting two but decided on 1 and was going to get another app instead. She proceeded to say that she definitely looked at the check twice and there was definitely 2 rung in which means we definitely ordered 2. Whatever, clearly we weren&amp;#39;t getting anywhere with her so we just told our waitress who made no big deal about it, took 1 back and said it was her mistake and we put in for the tomato and mozzerella flatbread. The apps were decent. The polenta fries were really good, soft and pillowy on the inside, a nice crunch on the outside, and the marinara was delicious and a perfect compliment to the polenta. <br&gt;<br&gt;The flatbread was ok. The tomatoes not being in season lacked flavor, but the basil and the rest of it was tasty. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d get that again.<br&gt;<br&gt;Being it was my first visit to this location, and some years since visiting the Chicago location I ordered the Chicken Madeira on our waitresses recommendation. It was served with a nice helping of mashed potatoes on the side. The mashed potatoes had great flavor, but being a former waitress myself, I knew my entree sat in the window for a hot minute because there was a crunch on top of them from sitting under a heat lamp. The chicken itself was tender and tasty, but I&amp;#39;m torn on the sauce. It was very very sweet. A little spice or even some fresh black pepper could have gone a long way. It was maybe just a little too sweet for my liking, but it wasn&amp;#39;t bad or anything. Very much like a sweet marsala sauce. The cheese was definitely a nice touch. <br&gt;<br&gt;The rest of the party seemed to enjoy their dishes. They each got a pasta dish and had no real complaints. <br&gt;<br&gt;For desert we of course got cheesecake. I&amp;#39;m pretty traditional when it comes to cheesecake, I like it plain so I can enjoy the pure goodness of the cheesecake. The cheesecake itself was delicious, light and pillowy but full of cheesecake flavor. Of course the crust has to be as good as the cheesecake part of it, and this one lacked a little. There wasn&amp;#39;t a lot of it and I like a lot of crust. One of my fellow diners ordered a Macademia nut cheesecake and that one was heaven in a cheesecake. You still maintained the originality of a cheesecake with some macademia nuts inside, but the crust was simply amazing. It was a blondie butter brown sugar type crust, but it was thick and gooey and absolutely amazing. I would definitely recommend that cheesecake for sure.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall I would return and try some different items.

It also gets one star in comparison to other Cheesecake Factories I&amp;#39;ve been to as well as in comparison to other restaurants that are in the same genre/tier. <br&gt;<br&gt;We went on a Sunday night and had to wait 4 hours to get in. Four hours! Part of the reason we had to wait so long was because we had a party of 13. We were celebrating my mom&amp;#39;s birthday and she really wanted to try it out so we did... <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been to The Cheesecake Factory in Honolulu and it was really no big deal to me. The food was fine. Not bad, not great. This time around was pretty much the same, but worse. First off, the floor was absolutely disgusting. There was so much grime on the floors that you never really had good traction \u00a0when walking. Totally gross. They needed someone to clean the floors during the busyness of the rush(es) and that clearly never happened.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and the shrimp part was fantastic - I&amp;#39;d totally eat that again. At the same time, the rice that came with it was hard and bland. My friends and family ordered steaks and that was a complete debacle. My mom wanted the hibachi steak and was told that they ran out of that steak for the day. Odd... Then 10 minutes after we ordered, the waitress came back out to tell some other friends at our table that they didn&amp;#39;t have the kind of steak that they wanted either. Ridiculous! Why did it take them 10 minutes after we ordered to tell us that they didn&amp;#39;t have it??? As a result, my mom and my friends ended up ordering one kind of steak with another kind of steak&amp;#39;s veggies and toppings - per our waitresses recommendation. You&amp;#39;d think that would all come out together, but no, they brought the veggies and toppings out separate and several minutes before the steaks came. This made for 4 or 5 extra plates on our table. More ridiculousness! I ended up having some of the steaks and they were just ok... I told my wife that they were like &amp;#34;better versions of a steak you might find at Ponderosa&amp;#34;.<br&gt;<br&gt;Seems to me like this location needs new management. When in Hawaii, the Cheesecake Factory there was well run. This location was like a bad, bad impression of Hawaii&amp;#39;s. I wanted to really enjoy this place, but they almost made it impossible. <br&gt;<br&gt;On a brighter note, as soon as we were seated the wait staff brought out free slices of bread and bananas for all the kids we had with us. That was really nice. But not enough to offset the other stuff that happened. <br&gt;<br&gt;If I ever go back, it&amp;#39;ll be because someone else suggested it. I&amp;#39;d get the Jamaican Shrimp again for sure. But I&amp;#39;d be totally fine never going back there again... The cheesecake is great, but you can get great cheesecake elsewhere around these parts (Sweet Lorraine&amp;#39;s). In the end we felt like we coulda just gone to J.

No one had any idea what they were doing (patrons), but that IS the staff&amp;#39;s responsibility. It was executed very, very poorly. So bad in fact that I had to push my way to get to the register.

I could have easily eaten the entire entree myself. It was small enough that I actually had to share my salad with him.

I am a frequent visitor of this franchise in Chicago, Las Vegas, and San Diego, but Novi was not comparable.

I expected the food to be better especially because the establishment had been open about 3 months prior. \u00a0First, they were very busy with one single waitress waiting on all the tables in the area, who was extremely rude. The menus itself were seriously gross-they were very greasy so I automatically felt dirty and disgusting eating in there. We ordered sliders as apps, an ahi tuna roll, and fried shrimp (dynamite shrimp) i believe it is called. The sliders were tasteless, the tuna roll was okay but nothing amazing, and the dynamite shrimp tasted like fried batter. We also asked for fresh bread because the first time it came out it was not good or fresh. When we got the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; batch it was just as cold and I could tell it was old because it was just so flaky and dry.

She greeted us as soon as we were seated and quickly brought us a round of water , bread, and butter. She also gave great suggestions and offered to answer any questions we had. i ordered the caribbean cooler which was really yummy and refreshing! (one complaint i do have is that the drink was not strong at all- tasted like the bartender forgot to add alcohol to it, and i generally don&amp;#39;t like my drinks strong!) For my entree, I decided to go with one of her suggestions, which was the Farfalle Pasta with Chicken and Roasted Garlic, which is a bow tie pasta with chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas, and caramelized onions in a roasted garlic-parmesan cream sauce. I brought up how I wanted to substitute the chicken with shrimp (due to no meat on Fridays during Lent), and she was very accommodating and even informed me of the pancetta (which is bacon), and asked me whether or not I wanted to take it out as well. The pasta was soooo good! I would definitely come back and order it again! After dinner I ordered the Tiramisu Cheesecake and my s/o ordered the red velvet cheesecake. Both were very delicious. I was surprised that the tiramisu cheesecake was very light and fluffy, rather than tasting overly sweet and heavy like most cheesecakes. overall i had a wonderful experience (minus the waiting time). i really do hope that cheesecake factory would consider taking reservations! especially for people who want to have birthday parties who wouldn&amp;#39;t want to have to wait an hour + for a table! i think opening up another cheesecake factory within MI would help as well!", "rating": 4, "date": "4/19/2014"}, {"text": "The food is phenomenal, as always at any Cheesecake Factory location.
